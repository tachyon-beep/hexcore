# Rethinking Expert Training: A Skills-Based Approach to MTG AI Specialization

You've had an important insight about how to conceptualize your training approach. Thinking of experts as "jobs" that require different combinations of skills—rather than entirely separate training regimens—is a more flexible and powerful paradigm. This approach better mirrors how human expertise develops and can lead to more efficient training of your AI system.

## The Skills-Based Training Paradigm

In this revised approach, we can think of each expert as requiring a particular constellation of skills, with each skill developed through specific training packages. Different experts may share many of the same skills but apply them in different ways according to their specialized roles.

### Core Skills for MTG AI Experts

Let's identify some of the fundamental skills that might be relevant across multiple expert types:

1. **MTG Knowledge** - Understanding of cards, rules, mechanics, and interactions
2. **Logical Reasoning** - Ability to apply rules correctly and derive valid conclusions
3. **Strategic Analysis** - Evaluation of game states and lines of play
4. **Structured Thinking** - Organizing analysis in coherent, systematic frameworks
5. **Communication Clarity** - Explaining concepts clearly at appropriate levels
6. **Educational Scaffolding** - Breaking down complex concepts into learnable pieces
7. **Quality Assessment** - Identifying errors, inconsistencies, or omissions
8. **Historical Context** - Understanding past game states and decision points

### Training Packages for Each Skill

Each of these skills would have one or more training packages that develop specific aspects of that skill:

**MTG Knowledge Packages:**

- Basic Rules & Mechanics
- Advanced Interactions
- Format-Specific Knowledge
- Card Recognition & Categorization

**Logical Reasoning Packages:**

- Rules Application
- Sequential Logic
- Stack Resolution
- Timing & Priority Analysis

**Structured Thinking Packages:**

- OODA Framework Application
- Step-by-Step Analysis
- Decision Tree Construction
- Scenario Mapping

**Quality Assessment Packages:**

- Rules Accuracy Verification
- Strategic Soundness Evaluation
- Completeness Checking
- Consistency Analysis

## Expert Skill Matrices

Using this approach, we can map which skills each expert needs and to what degree. Here's how that might look:

| Skill                   | REASON | EXPLAIN | TEACH  | PREDICT | RETROSPECT | OODA   | QA     |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| MTG Knowledge           | High   | High    | High   | High    | High       | High   | High   |
| Logical Reasoning       | High   | Medium  | Medium | High    | High       | High   | High   |
| Strategic Analysis      | Medium | Low     | Low    | High    | High       | High   | Medium |
| Structured Thinking     | Medium | Medium  | High   | Medium  | Medium     | High   | High   |
| Communication Clarity   | Medium | High    | High   | Medium  | Medium     | Low    | Medium |
| Educational Scaffolding | Low    | Medium  | High   | Low     | Low        | Low    | Low    |
| Quality Assessment      | Medium | Low     | Low    | Low     | Medium     | Medium | High   |
| Historical Context      | Low    | Low     | Low    | Low     | High       | Low    | Low    |

This matrix helps visualize that:

1. All experts need high MTG Knowledge
2. The OODA expert needs high Structured Thinking and Strategic Analysis
3. The QA expert needs high Quality Assessment and Structured Thinking
4. Each expert has a unique skill profile reflecting its specialized role

## Implementation Approach

The implementation of this skills-based approach would involve several steps:

### 1. Create Skill-Specific Training Datasets

Rather than creating expert-specific datasets directly, first create datasets focused on developing each skill independently. For example:

- A dataset focused on MTG knowledge development
- A dataset focused on logical reasoning within MTG
- A dataset focused on applying the OODA framework to various situations
- A dataset focused on quality assessment and error detection

### 2. Build Skill-Development Training Phases

Design training procedures that develop each skill incrementally:

- Basic skill development phase
- Intermediate application phase
- Advanced mastery phase

### 3. Define Expert-Specific Training Combinations

For each expert type, create a training regimen that combines the appropriate skill packages according to the needs of that role. For example:

**OODA Expert Training:**

1. High MTG Knowledge → Basic, Advanced, and Format-Specific Knowledge packages
2. High Logical Reasoning → All reasoning packages
3. High Strategic Analysis → All strategic analysis packages
4. High Structured Thinking → OODA Framework package especially
5. Medium Quality Assessment → Basic accuracy and completeness packages

**QA Expert Training:**

1. High MTG Knowledge → Basic, Advanced, and Format-Specific Knowledge packages
2. High Logical Reasoning → All reasoning packages
3. High Quality Assessment → All quality assessment packages
4. High Structured Thinking → Multiple structured thinking packages
5. Medium Strategic Analysis → Basic strategic evaluation package

### 4. Implement Progressive Skill Transfer

Rather than training all skills simultaneously, implement a progressive approach:

1. First develop foundational skills (MTG Knowledge, Logical Reasoning)
2. Then build specialized skills on this foundation
3. Finally, integrate multiple skills into cohesive expert behaviors

## Benefits of this Approach

This skills-based approach offers several significant advantages:

### 1. Training Efficiency

By creating skill-specific training packages that can be reused across multiple experts, you reduce the total amount of training data needed. This is especially valuable for skills that are broadly applicable, like MTG knowledge.

### 2. Consistent Foundations

Ensuring all experts share the same training for foundational skills helps maintain consistency across the system. This reduces the risk of different experts having contradictory understandings of basic game mechanics.

### 3. Easier Adaptation and Evolution

If you want to improve a particular skill across multiple experts, you only need to refine the relevant skill package rather than retraining entire experts. This modular approach makes the system more maintainable.

### 4. More Flexible Expert Development

This approach makes it easier to create new expert types in the future. If you want to add a "JUDGE" expert that focuses on tournament rules, you can combine existing skill packages with a few new ones rather than starting from scratch.

### 5. Better Alignment with Human Expertise

This skills-based model better reflects how human expertise actually develops—through the acquisition and integration of multiple component skills rather than as a monolithic whole.

## Specific Application to OODA and QA Experts

With this framework in mind, your insight that both the OODA and QA experts should "get a shot of everything" makes perfect sense. These experts, in particular, need broad skill coverage because:

1. **The OODA Expert** needs to understand all aspects of Magic to provide comprehensive analysis. It needs strong MTG knowledge to observe accurately, strategic understanding to orient appropriately, logical reasoning to decide soundly, and practical knowledge to recommend actions.

2. **The QA Expert** needs to evaluate the outputs of all other experts, which requires it to understand all the skills those experts apply. It can't effectively assess strategic advice without strategic knowledge, can't verify rules accuracy without rules knowledge, and so on.

This perspective transforms how you might approach training these experts. Rather than seeing them as completely distinct, you'd recognize that they share many skill requirements but apply them with different emphases and for different purposes.

Both experts would indeed benefit from exposure to all training packages, with special emphasis on the ones most critical to their respective roles. This ensures they have the breadth of knowledge needed while still developing the specialized capabilities that make them valuable contributors to your overall system.
