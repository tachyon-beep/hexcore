{"input": "Given that I control Tarmogoyf and my opponent casts Lightning Bolt targeting it, what happens if there are no instants in any graveyard before Lightning Bolt resolves?", "output": "When your opponent casts Lightning Bolt targeting your Tarmogoyf, we need to analyze the sequence of events carefully:\n\n1. Lightning Bolt is cast, targeting Tarmogoyf.\n2. Lightning Bolt is on the stack, but has not yet resolved.\n3. At this point, we check Tarmogoyf's toughness, which depends on the card types in all graveyards.\n4. You mentioned there are no instants in any graveyard before Lightning Bolt resolves.\n5. When Lightning Bolt resolves, it will deal 3 damage to Tarmogoyf.\n6. Then, Lightning Bolt will go to the graveyard as part of the resolution.\n7. At this point, there is now an instant (Lightning Bolt) in a graveyard.\n\nHowever, by the time Lightning Bolt has finished resolving and is in the graveyard, the 3 damage has already been dealt to Tarmogoyf based on its toughness before the instant entered the graveyard. The damage doesn't retroactively change.\n\nSo if Tarmogoyf's toughness was 3 or greater before Lightning Bolt resolved, it would survive. If its toughness was 2 or less, it would die before Lightning Bolt entering the graveyard could increase its toughness."}
{"input": "I control a Phyrexian Metamorph copying a Sakura-Tribe Elder. My opponent plays Humility. What does the Metamorph look like now?", "output": "Let's analyze this step by step based on dependency and timestamp principles in MTG's layer system:\n\n1. Phyrexian Metamorph was copying Sakura-Tribe Elder, making it a 1/1 green Snake Shaman with the sacrifice ability to search for a basic land.\n\n2. Humility enters the battlefield with a newer timestamp. Humility creates a continuous effect that sets creatures' base power and toughness to 1/1 and removes all abilities from creatures.\n\n3. When applying continuous effects, we follow the layer system:\n   - Layer 1 (Copy effects): Metamorph's copy effect is applied first, making it a copy of Sakura-Tribe Elder\n   - Layer 6 (Ability adding/removing effects): Humility removes all abilities from creatures, including the Metamorph's copied abilities\n   - Layer 7b (P/T setting effects): Humility sets base P/T to 1/1\n\nSo the final state of Phyrexian Metamorph would be:\n- It's still a green Snake Shaman (creature types are preserved)\n- It has power and toughness 1/1 (set by Humility)\n- It has no abilities (removed by Humility)\n\nThe Metamorph essentially becomes a vanilla 1/1 green Snake Shaman with no abilities."}
{"input": "If I control Chalice of the Void with one counter on it and cast Chalice of the Void for X=2, will the first Chalice counter the second?", "output": "No, the first Chalice of the Void with one counter on it will not counter the second Chalice that you cast for X=2.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Chalice of the Void has the ability: \"Whenever a player casts a spell with converted mana cost/mana value equal to the number of charge counters on Chalice of the Void, counter that spell.\"\n\n2. When you cast the second Chalice of the Void with X=2, its mana value on the stack is determined by its casting cost. The mana value of a spell with X in its cost includes the value chosen for X while the spell is on the stack.\n\n3. So, the second Chalice of the Void has a mana value of 2 + 2 = 4 (two mana for X=2, plus the base cost of 2).\n\n4. The first Chalice of the Void has one counter on it, so it only counters spells with mana value 1.\n\n5. Since the second Chalice has a mana value of 4 on the stack, not 1, the first Chalice will not trigger to counter it.\n\nTherefore, the second Chalice of the Void will resolve successfully, entering the battlefield with 2 charge counters."}
{"input": "I control Hinata, Dawn-Crowned. If I cast Urza's Rage with kicker, how much mana do I need to pay?", "output": "To determine how much mana you need to pay for Urza's Rage with kicker while controlling Hinata, Dawn-Crowned, we need to understand the interaction between cost reduction and kicker costs.\n\nHinata, Dawn-Crowned says: \"Spells you cast that target one or more creatures or planeswalkers cost {1} less to cast for each creature and/or planeswalker they target.\"\n\nUrza's Rage is an instant with a cost of {2}{R} that deals 3 damage to any target. It also has a kicker cost of {8}{R}. When kicked, it deals 10 damage instead and can't be countered by spells or abilities.\n\nSince Urza's Rage targets exactly one permanent (could be a creature or planeswalker in this case), it gets a {1} discount from Hinata.\n\nSo the calculations are:\n\n1. Base cost of Urza's Rage: {2}{R}\n2. Discount from Hinata: {1}\n3. Base cost after discount: {1}{R}\n4. Kicker cost: {8}{R} (the kicker cost is not reduced by Hinata as it's an additional cost, not part of the original cost that gets reduced)\n\nTotal cost to cast Urza's Rage with kicker: {1}{R} + {8}{R} = {9}{R}{R} or 11 mana total (9 generic, 2 red).\n\nNote: If Urza's Rage targeted a non-creature, non-planeswalker permanent or a player, Hinata would provide no discount."}
{"input": "If I control Darien, King of Kjeldor and play Mana Crypt, what happens if I lose the coin flip during my upkeep?", "output": "Here's the sequence of events that occurs when you control Darien, King of Kjeldor and play Mana Crypt, then lose the coin flip during your upkeep:\n\n1. During your upkeep, Mana Crypt's ability triggers, forcing you to flip a coin.\n\n2. If you lose the flip, Mana Crypt deals 3 damage to you.\n\n3. When you take damage, Darien, King of Kjeldor's ability triggers. Darien's ability states: \"Whenever you're dealt damage, you may create that many 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens.\"\n\n4. Since you were dealt 3 damage, Darien's ability allows you to create 3 white 1/1 Soldier tokens.\n\nSo the net result is:\n- You take 3 damage from Mana Crypt\n- You create 3 white 1/1 Soldier creature tokens\n\nThis interaction can be quite beneficial despite taking damage, as you're effectively converting the damage into creature tokens, which can be valuable for building a board presence or for other effects that care about creatures entering the battlefield."}
{"input": "If I control The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale and my opponent controls Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, how much do I have to pay to keep my creatures?", "output": "This interaction involves understanding how multiple taxation effects work together.\n\nThe Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale gives all creatures an ability that says \"At the beginning of your upkeep, destroy this creature unless you pay {1}.\" This means each player must pay {1} for each creature they control during their upkeep or those creatures will be destroyed.\n\nThalia, Guardian of Thraben has the static ability: \"Noncreature spells cost {1} more to cast.\" However, this ability only affects the casting of noncreature spells and has no effect on activated or triggered abilities.\n\nThe upkeep cost from The Tabernacle is a triggered ability, not a spell being cast. Therefore, Thalia's tax does not apply to this payment.\n\nSo, you would still only need to pay {1} for each creature you control during your upkeep to satisfy The Tabernacle's requirement, regardless of your opponent controlling Thalia.\n\nNote that if YOU controlled Thalia, it wouldn't change this interaction either, as again, Thalia only affects noncreature spells, not triggered ability payments."}
{"input": "If I have Yawgmoth's Will and cast a spell from my graveyard, what happens if my opponent counters it?", "output": "When you have Yawgmoth's Will and cast a spell from your graveyard that gets countered, here's what happens:\n\n1. Yawgmoth's Will lets you play cards from your graveyard this turn, with the additional rule that if a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile it instead.\n\n2. When you cast a spell from your graveyard, it moves from the graveyard to the stack (just like when casting from hand).\n\n3. Your opponent counters the spell while it's on the stack.\n\n4. Normally, a countered spell would go to its owner's graveyard.\n\n5. However, because of Yawgmoth's Will's replacement effect, instead of going to your graveyard, the countered spell is exiled.\n\nThe key point here is that once you've cast the spell from your graveyard, it's no longer in the graveyard - it's on the stack. When countered, it would normally return to the graveyard, but Yawgmoth's Will exiles it instead.\n\nThis means you can't cast that specific card again this turn, even with Yawgmoth's Will still active, because the card is now in exile, not in your graveyard."}
{"input": "I control Containment Priest and my opponent activates Sneak Attack to put Emrakul, the Aeons Torn into play. What happens?", "output": "Let's analyze this interaction step by step:\n\n1. Containment Priest has the ability: \"If a nontoken creature would enter the battlefield and it wasn't cast, exile it instead.\"\n\n2. Sneak Attack has the ability: \"Pay {R}: You may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. That creature gains haste. Sacrifice the creature at the beginning of the next end step.\"\n\n3. Your opponent activates Sneak Attack, paying {R} and choosing to put Emrakul, the Aeons Torn from their hand onto the battlefield.\n\n4. This would cause Emrakul to enter the battlefield without being cast, which triggers Containment Priest's replacement effect.\n\n5. Instead of entering the battlefield, Emrakul is exiled.\n\n6. Since Emrakul never enters the battlefield, the delayed triggered ability from Sneak Attack that would cause it to be sacrificed at the beginning of the next end step doesn't create a trigger because the creature it's tracking never existed on the battlefield.\n\n7. Emrakul, the Aeons Torn has its own triggered ability: \"When Emrakul is put into a graveyard from anywhere, its owner shuffles their graveyard into their library.\" However, this ability doesn't trigger because Emrakul is being put into exile, not into a graveyard.\n\nSo, the end result is that Emrakul is exiled and stays there. Your opponent spent {R} for no benefit, and Emrakul doesn't enter the battlefield, doesn't gain haste, doesn't get sacrificed later, and doesn't trigger its graveyard shuffle ability."}
{"input": "I control Dauthi Voidwalker and Blood Moon. My opponent plays Scalding Tarn and cracks it. What happens?", "output": "Let's analyze this complex interaction step by step:\n\n1. You control Dauthi Voidwalker, which has the ability: \"If a card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it with a void counter on it instead.\"\n\n2. You also control Blood Moon, which states: \"Nonbasic lands are Mountains.\"\n\n3. Your opponent plays Scalding Tarn, which would normally be a nonbasic land with a fetch ability, but because of Blood Moon, it enters the battlefield as a Mountain instead.\n\n4. As a Mountain, Scalding Tarn loses all its original abilities (including the fetch ability to sacrifice it to search for a land) and gains \"{T}: Add {R}\".\n\n5. When your opponent attempts to \"crack\" it (i.e., activate its sacrifice ability to search for a land), they cannot do so because that ability doesn't exist while Blood Moon is in effect.\n\nIn summary, your opponent cannot activate Scalding Tarn's fetch ability at all. It's simply a Mountain with the tap ability to add red mana. The interaction with Dauthi Voidwalker's replacement effect never comes into play because the situation where Scalding Tarn would go to the graveyard doesn't arise."}
{"input": "I control Teferi, Time Raveler. My opponent casts Krosan Grip targeting my Chromatic Sphere. Can I activate Chromatic Sphere in response?", "output": "This is an interesting interaction that involves understanding both Split Second and Teferi's static ability. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Your opponent casts Krosan Grip, which has Split Second. The Split Second ability states: \"As long as this spell is on the stack, players can't cast spells or activate abilities that aren't mana abilities.\"\n\n2. You control Teferi, Time Raveler, whose static ability states: \"Each opponent can cast spells only any time they could cast a sorcery.\" This restricts when your opponents can cast spells, but doesn't affect the properties of spells once they're on the stack.\n\n3. Krosan Grip targets your Chromatic Sphere, which has an activated ability that costs {1}, {T}, sacrificing it to draw a card and add one mana of any color. This is a mana ability because it produces mana, even though it has an additional effect (drawing a card).\n\n4. The key question is whether Split Second prevents you from activating Chromatic Sphere's ability.\n\n5. According to rule 702.60a, Split Second means \"As long as this spell is on the stack, players can't cast spells or activate abilities that aren't mana abilities.\"\n\n6. Since Chromatic Sphere's ability is a mana ability (it adds one mana of any color), it can be activated even while a spell with Split Second is on the stack.\n\nTherefore, yes, you can activate Chromatic Sphere's ability in response to Krosan Grip, despite Split Second, because Chromatic Sphere's ability is a mana ability. You'll sacrifice the Sphere, draw a card, and add one mana of any color to your mana pool before Krosan Grip resolves, which means Krosan Grip will fail to destroy the Sphere upon resolution because it's no longer on the battlefield."}
{"input": "I control Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and a Blood Moon enters the battlefield. What types are my lands?","output": "This is a question about layers and timestamps, specifically how type-changing effects interact. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth has the ability: \"Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types.\"\n\n2. Blood Moon has the ability: \"Nonbasic lands are Mountains.\"\n\n3. Both of these are type-changing effects, which are applied in Layer 4 of the layer system (rule 613.1d).\n\n4. When multiple effects apply in the same layer, they're generally applied in timestamp order (rule 613.7). The effect that existed first is applied first, then the newer effect is applied, potentially overwriting aspects of the earlier effect.\n\n5. In this scenario, Urborg was on the battlefield first, then Blood Moon entered. So Urborg's effect is applied first, making all lands into Swamps (in addition to their other types), then Blood Moon's effect is applied, making all nonbasic lands into Mountains.\n\n6. Blood Moon's effect doesn't say \"in addition to its other types\" - it sets the land type completely, removing all other land types and abilities.\n\n7. The result is that all nonbasic lands (including Urborg itself, unless it's somehow been made a basic land) will be Mountains, not Swamps. They lose all other land types and abilities.\n\n8. Basic lands are unaffected by Blood Moon, so if you control any basic lands, those would still be Swamps (in addition to their original basic land type) because of Urborg's effect.\n\nTo summarize: After Blood Moon enters the battlefield, all your nonbasic lands (including Urborg) will be Mountains only, while your basic lands will be both their original type and Swamps."}
{"input": "I control a Voice of Resurgence and a Rest in Peace. If Voice of Resurgence dies, do I get an Elemental token?","output": "This interaction involves understanding how replacement effects interact with triggered abilities. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Voice of Resurgence has the ability: \"When Voice of Resurgence dies, create a green and white Elemental creature token with 'This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.'\"\n\n2. Rest in Peace has the ability: \"If a card or token would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.\"\n\n3. When Voice of Resurgence would die, normally it would be put into the graveyard, which would trigger its death ability.\n\n4. However, Rest in Peace creates a replacement effect that modifies what happens when a creature dies. Instead of going to the graveyard, the creature is exiled.\n\n5. According to rule 603.6c, if a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes a trigger to trigger, that ability will still trigger if the specified event occurs.\n\n6. Importantly, rule 700.4 defines \"dies\" as: \"A creature or planeswalker 'dies' if it is put into a graveyard from the battlefield.\"\n\n7. Since Rest in Peace's replacement effect exiles Voice of Resurgence instead of it going to the graveyard, the Voice technically doesn't \"die\" as defined by the game rules. It goes to exile instead of the graveyard.\n\n8. Because Voice of Resurgence never \"dies\" in the technical sense, its death trigger never occurs.\n\nTherefore, if Voice of Resurgence leaves the battlefield while you control Rest in Peace, you will not get an Elemental token, because the Voice didn't \"die\" as defined by the game rules—it was exiled instead."}
{"input": "I attack with a 3/3 Woolly Thoctar equipped with Loxodon Warhammer. My opponent blocks with a 2/2 White Knight. How much damage do I deal to my opponent?","output": "This interaction involves understanding how protection and combat damage work. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. You attack with a 3/3 Woolly Thoctar (a red, green, and white creature) equipped with Loxodon Warhammer, which gives it +3/+0 and lifelink and trample.\n\n2. With the equipment, your Woolly Thoctar is a 6/3 creature with lifelink and trample.\n\n3. Your opponent blocks with a 2/2 White Knight, which has protection from black and from red.\n\n4. Protection provides four benefits, often remembered with the acronym DEBT: the protected creature can't be Damaged, Enchanted/Equipped, Blocked, or Targeted by anything with the stated quality.\n\n5. Since Woolly Thoctar is red (among other colors), White Knight's protection from red means that the Knight can't be damaged by the Thoctar.\n\n6. When a creature with trample is blocked, its controller assigns combat damage by first assigning at least lethal damage to all blocking creatures, then any excess damage can be assigned to the defending player.\n\n7. Normally, you would need to assign at least 2 damage to the 2/2 Knight (lethal damage), and the remaining 4 damage could trample over to your opponent.\n\n8. However, because White Knight has protection from red, it can't be damaged by your red Thoctar. But rule 702.19b states: \"The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player or planeswalker the creature is attacking.\"\n\n9. The key phrase is \"assigned lethal damage,\" not \"dealt lethal damage.\" You still must assign what would be lethal damage to the White Knight, even though that damage will be prevented due to protection.\n\n10. Therefore, you must assign 2 damage to the White Knight (which will be prevented) and can assign the remaining 4 damage to your opponent.\n\n11. Your opponent will take 4 damage, and you will gain 4 life from lifelink (which is based on damage dealt, and you're dealing 4 damage to the opponent).\n\nTo summarize: You will deal 4 damage to your opponent and gain 4 life through lifelink."}
{"input": "I control Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and cast Pyroclasm. My opponent controls a 3/3 Centaur Courser and a 4/4 Bristling Boar. What happens to their creatures?","output": "This interaction involves damage enhancement and state-based actions. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell has the ability: \"If a red source you control would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, it deals that much damage plus 2 instead.\"\n\n2. Pyroclasm is a red sorcery that says: \"Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.\"\n\n3. Your opponent controls a 3/3 Centaur Courser and a 4/4 Bristling Boar.\n\n4. When Pyroclasm resolves, it would normally deal 2 damage to each creature.\n\n5. However, because you control Torbran, and Pyroclasm is a red source you control, it will deal 2+2=4 damage to each creature your opponent controls.\n\n6. The Centaur Courser, a 3/3 creature, takes 4 damage. This is greater than its toughness, so it will die when state-based actions are checked.\n\n7. The Bristling Boar, a 4/4 creature, also takes 4 damage. Since the damage equals its toughness, it has been dealt lethal damage and will also die when state-based actions are checked.\n\n8. After Pyroclasm resolves, state-based actions are checked, and both creatures are put into the graveyard.\n\nIt's worth noting that even if your opponent had a way to make one of their creatures indestructible at instant speed, that wouldn't save it from lethal damage in this case, because by the time they would get priority to cast such a spell, Pyroclasm would have already resolved and state-based actions would have already destroyed the creatures with lethal damage marked on them.\n\nTo summarize: Both the 3/3 Centaur Courser and the 4/4 Bristling Boar will die, as each takes 4 damage from the enhanced Pyroclasm."}
{"input": "I cast Clone targeting a face-down Vesuvan Shapeshifter that was placed using Dread. What happens?","output": "This interaction involves understanding copy effects and face-down permanents. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Clone is a creature that enters the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.\n\n2. Vesuvan Shapeshifter is a creature that can be cast face-down as a 2/2 creature (using the morph ability), and when face-down, it has no name, no mana cost, and no abilities other than the ability to turn it face up for its morph cost.\n\n3. According to rule 707.2, when copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object. Copiable values are the values derived from the text printed on the object, as modified by other copy effects, plus values set by \"enters the battlefield as\" abilities.\n\n4. Rule 707.2 also states: \"The 'copiable values' are the values derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its face-down status, and by 'as ... enters the battlefield' and 'as ... is turned face up' abilities that set power and toughness.\"\n\n5. Crucially, rule 707.9 specifies: \"A copy effect that copies a face-down permanent doesn't copy its face-down status. The copy will be face up.\"\n\n6. Rule 707.10 further adds: \"To determine the copiable values of an object that's copying a face-down object, consider the copiable values of the face-down object to be the same as those printed on the face of the card or token.\"\n\n7. This means that when Clone copies a face-down Vesuvan Shapeshifter, it doesn't copy the characteristics of the generic 2/2 face-down creature, but rather the actual printed characteristics of Vesuvan Shapeshifter.\n\n8. Therefore, Clone will enter the battlefield as a face-up copy of Vesuvan Shapeshifter, with all its normal characteristics – a 0/0 blue Shapeshifter creature with the Vesuvan Shapeshifter's printed abilities, including the ability to turn face down at the beginning of your upkeep.\n\nTo summarize: When Clone copies a face-down Vesuvan Shapeshifter, the Clone enters the battlefield as a face-up Vesuvan Shapeshifter with all its normal characteristics, not as a copy of a generic 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, or abilities."}
{"input": "I control Stony Silence and my opponent casts Mycosynth Lattice. What happens?", "output": "Your Stony Silence is on the battlefield, and it prevents activated abilities of artifacts from being activated. When your opponent casts Mycosynth Lattice, it enters as an artifact with a static ability that turns all permanents into artifacts. Since Mycosynth Lattice's ability is static and not activated, Stony Silence does not affect it. The static effect will apply normally, turning every permanent (including Stony Silence itself) into an artifact. However, any activated abilities on artifacts are still disabled. Thus, while the lattice’s continuous effect takes hold, any activated abilities from it or other artifacts are prevented from being used."}
{"input": "I control Notion Thief. My opponent draws a card. What happens?", "output": "Notion Thief is a creature with a replacement effect that says: 'If an opponent would draw a card, instead you draw that many cards.' When your opponent attempts to draw a card, Notion Thief’s effect replaces that event. Instead of your opponent drawing a card, you draw that card, and your opponent does not draw at all."}
{"input": "If I control both Panharmonicon and Yarok, the Desecrated, and a creature enters the battlefield under my control causing an ETB ability to trigger, how many times does it trigger?", "output": "Let's analyze this interaction using Magic's replacement effect rules:\n\n1. Panharmonicon states: \"If an artifact or creature entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.\"\n\n2. Yarok, the Desecrated states: \"If a permanent entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.\"\n\n3. These are both replacement effects that modify how many times an ability triggers. Replacement effects with \"additional time\" wording are multiplicative.\n\n4. When a creature enters the battlefield:\n - The base trigger occurs once\n - Panharmonicon adds one additional trigger\n - Yarok adds another additional trigger\n\n5. The total number of triggers = 1 (original) + 1 (Panharmonicon) + 1 (Yarok) = 3 triggers\n\nThis occurs because both replacement effects apply independently. The entering permanent is both a creature (satisfying Panharmonicon) and any permanent type (satisfying Yarok), meaning both replacement effects can modify the same event. The triggers stack additively rather than exponentially in this case."}
{"input": "I control Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies. Can I generate infinite green mana?", "output": "Yes, you can generate infinite green mana with this combination. Let's analyze the rules interaction:\n\n1. Devoted Druid has two relevant abilities:\n   - \"{T}: Add {G}\" - A basic mana ability\n   - \"Put a -1/-1 counter on Devoted Druid: Untap Devoted Druid\" - An activated ability with a counter placement cost\n\n2. Vizier of Remedies has the static ability: \"If one or more -1/-1 counters would be put on a creature you control, that many -1/-1 counters minus one are put on it instead.\"\n\n3. When you activate Devoted Druid's untap ability, you attempt to put one -1/-1 counter on it as the cost. However, Vizier's replacement effect modifies this.\n\n4. Since you're trying to put exactly one -1/-1 counter on Devoted Druid, Vizier's effect reduces this to zero counters (1 minus 1 = 0).\n\n5. You still fully pay the cost (which has been modified to placing 0 counters), so the ability resolves and Devoted Druid untaps.\n\n6. Since no counter was placed on Devoted Druid, its power and toughness remain unchanged at 0/2.\n\n7. You can now tap Devoted Druid again for {G}, then activate its untap ability, repeating this process indefinitely.\n\nThis works because replacement effects modify what would happen before it actually occurs. The -1/-1 counter is never actually placed on Devoted Druid, but the cost is still considered paid.\n\nThe result is infinite green mana: tap for {G}, untap (with no counter placed), repeat."}
{"input": "I control Narset, Parter of Veils and my opponent controls Forced Fruition. If I cast a spell, what happens?", "output": "This interaction involves contradictory effects between card draw restriction and forced card draw. Let's analyze step by step:\n\n1. Narset, Parter of Veils has a static ability: \"Each opponent can't draw more than one card each turn.\"\n\n2. Forced Fruition has a triggered ability: \"Whenever an opponent casts a spell, that player draws seven cards.\"\n\n3. When you cast a spell, your opponent's Forced Fruition triggers, creating an effect that would cause you to draw seven cards.\n\n4. However, Narset's static ability creates a restriction that says your opponent cannot draw more than one card during your turn.\n\n5. According to rule 614.10 in the Comprehensive Rules: \"If an effect would cause a player to [do something] and another effect states that the player can't [do that], the 'can't' effect wins.\"\n\n6. This means that Narset's restriction takes precedence over Forced Fruition's effect.\n\n7. When Forced Fruition's ability resolves, your opponent will only draw one card, not seven, because Narset's effect prevents them from drawing more than one card.\n\n8. The remaining six card draws are simply not performed. They aren't delayed or saved for later - they just don't happen.\n\n9. It's important to note that this isn't a case of choosing the order of replacement effects, but rather a conflict between an effect trying to cause an action and another effect stating that action cannot be performed.\n\nThis interaction demonstrates the principle that \"can't\" effects override \"can\" effects in Magic. Narset's prohibition on drawing more than one card per turn takes precedence over Forced Fruition's instruction to draw seven cards."}
{"input": "If I cast Mycosynth Lattice and March of the Machines in the same turn, what happens to the board state?", "output": "This interaction creates one of Magic's most notorious board wipes. Let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:\n\n1. Mycosynth Lattice has the ability: \"All permanents are artifacts in addition to their other types.\"\n\n2. March of the Machines has the ability: \"Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature with power and toughness each equal to its mana value.\"\n\n3. When both cards are on the battlefield, these effects interact in the following way:\n   - Mycosynth Lattice makes all permanents artifacts (including lands)\n   - March of the Machines then turns all noncreature artifacts into creatures\n\n4. Lands are permanently assigned a mana value of 0, per rule 202.3a: \"The mana value of an object with no mana cost is 0, unless that object is the back face of a transforming double-faced permanent or is a melded permanent.\"\n\n5. This means all lands become 0/0 artifact creatures.\n\n6. State-based actions are then checked, and any creature with 0 or less toughness is put into its owner's graveyard. All lands die immediately.\n\n7. Other noncreature permanents become artifact creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value:\n   - Mycosynth Lattice becomes a 6/6 artifact creature\n   - March of the Machines becomes a 4/4 artifact enchantment creature\n   - All other permanents are similarly affected based on their mana values\n\n8. The result is that all lands are destroyed and most other permanents become creatures.\n\n9. This creates what's commonly called a \"mana lock\" - a situation where players cannot generate mana from lands anymore. The only sources of mana left would be creatures that can tap for mana or mana rocks that survived due to having at least 1 toughness.\n\n10. The game state essentially freezes for players who don't have alternative mana sources or ways to destroy either of these two cards.\n\nThis interaction is often used as a game-ending combo, either by having a way to break parity (such as having creatures that produce mana) or by including a way to sacrifice March of the Machines after the lands are destroyed (allowing your artifacts to remain intact while lands remain artifacts and can't be replayed)."}
{"input": "I control Humility and Opalescence. In what order do their effects apply and what happens to enchantments on the battlefield?", "output": "This is one of Magic's most complex layering interactions. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. Humility has the ability: \"All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.\"\n\n2. Opalescence has the ability: \"Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has power and toughness each equal to its mana value.\"\n\n3. When applying continuous effects, we follow the layer system in rule 613:\n   - Layer 4: Type-changing effects (including adding/removing creature types)\n   - Layer 6: Ability adding/removing effects\n   - Layer 7b: Power/toughness setting effects\n\n4. In Layer 4, Opalescence's type-changing effect applies, making all non-Aura enchantments (including Humility) into creatures.\n\n5. In Layer 6, Humility's ability-removing effect applies to all creatures (which now includes most enchantments), removing all their abilities.\n\n6. However, rule 613.5 establishes an exception to the layer system: the game must account for an effect's dependencies. Effect A depends on effect B if applying B would change the text or existence of A.\n\n7. Humility's effect depends on Opalescence's effect because Opalescence determines whether Humility affects itself (by making Humility a creature).\n\n8. Therefore, despite timestamps, Opalescence's effect is always applied before Humility's effect in Layer 6.\n\n9. The end result is:\n   - All non-Aura enchantments (including Humility) become creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value\n   - Then Humility's effect applies to all creatures (including itself and other enchantment creatures), removing all abilities and setting base P/T to 1/1\n   - Humility's ability-removing effect applies after its own ability has been established, so it doesn't remove its own effect\n\n10. All non-Aura enchantments end up as 1/1 creatures with no abilities. Auras remain as non-creature enchantments with their abilities intact (unless they were already creatures from another effect).\n\nThis interaction is famous for its complexity and has even been subject to rule changes and clarifications over the years."}
{"input": "I have Teferi's Protection and my opponent has Arcane Laboratory. Their Mindslaver resolves and they control my turn. What can they force me to do or not do?", "output": "This interaction involves understanding turn control, restrictions, and immunity. Let's analyze step by step:\n\n1. Mindslaver's effect allows your opponent to control your turn. The controller makes all decisions you would make during that turn, excluding choices required by restrctions.\n\n2. Arcane Laboratory creates a restriction: \"Each player can't cast more than one spell each turn.\"\n\n3. Teferi's Protection gives you several protections until your next turn:\n   - Your life total can't change\n   - You gain protection from everything\n   - Your permanents phase out\n   - You're immune to everything your opponents are doing\n\n4. The key ruling here is from Mindslaver: \"The controller doesn't control the player. Rather, the controller controls that player's turn. This is an important distinction because the controller of the player's turn can't cause the player to do anything outside of what they could do during the turn.\"\n\n5. Since you have Teferi's Protection active, you're \"immune to everything your opponents are doing\" - this means your opponent controlling your turn cannot force you to:\n   - Discard cards\n   - Sacrifice permanents\n   - Pay life or mana\n   - Cast spells\n\n6. Your opponent can still:\n   - Look at your hand (as this is a standard part of controlling your turn)\n   - Choose not to take any actions\n   - Watch as your phased-out permanents don't phase back in (since they phase in at the beginning of your turn, but before the Mindslaver effect controls your turn)\n\n7. During the process of controlling your turn, restriction effects like Arcane Laboratory are irrelevant because the controller can't make you cast any spells anyway due to your immunity from Teferi's Protection.\n\n8. When your turn ends, your opponent's control of your turn ends, but Teferi's Protection's effects continue until your next turn.\n\nIn summary, your opponent accomplishes almost nothing by activating Mindslaver with Teferi's Protection in effect. They cannot make you do anything that would affect your game state in a meaningful way because of your immunity."}
{"input": "If I control Painter's Servant (naming blue) and Iona, Shield of Emeria (naming blue), can my opponent cast any spells?", "output": "This is a powerful lockout combination that prevents opponents from casting spells. Let's analyze why:\n\n1. Painter's Servant has the ability: \"All cards that aren't on the battlefield, spells, and permanents are the chosen color in addition to their other colors.\" You've named blue as the chosen color.\n\n2. Iona, Shield of Emeria has the ability: \"Your opponents can't cast spells of the chosen color.\" You've also named blue for this effect.\n\n3. The key interaction is that Painter's Servant creates a continuous effect that applies in all zones, making every card blue in addition to its other colors.\n\n4. Since all cards are blue (including cards in hand, library, graveyard, on the stack, and in exile), and Iona prevents casting blue spells, the combined effect is that your opponents cannot cast any spells at all.\n\n5. This combination creates what's known as a \"hard lock\" - a state where your opponents cannot play spells of any kind.\n\n6. Your opponents can still:\n   - Activate abilities of permanents they control\n   - Play lands (since playing a land doesn't count as casting a spell)\n   - Use mana abilities\n   - Take game actions that don't involve casting spells\n\n7. However, without the ability to cast spells, most decks cannot meaningfully interact with or remove either piece of your combo.\n\n8. This combination was so powerful that Painter's Servant was banned in Commander format for many years specifically because of this interaction (though it has since been unbanned).\n\nThe combination effectively prevents your opponents from casting any spell of any kind from any zone, creating a nearly unbreakable lock unless they already have a way to remove one of the pieces using activated abilities of permanents they control."}
{"input": "I control Knowledge Pool and Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir. Can my opponents cast any spells?", "output": "This creates a complete lock preventing opponents from casting spells. Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Knowledge Pool has a triggered ability: \"Whenever a player casts a spell from their hand, that player exiles it. If the player does, that player may cast another nonland card exiled with Knowledge Pool without paying its mana cost.\"\n\n2. Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir has a static ability: \"Each opponent can cast spells only any time they could cast a sorcery.\" This restricts when opponents can cast spells to their main phases when the stack is empty.\n\n3. Let's examine what happens when an opponent tries to cast a spell:\n   - They attempt to cast a spell from their hand during their main phase\n   - Knowledge Pool's ability triggers and goes on the stack\n   - When the trigger resolves, the original spell is exiled\n   - Knowledge Pool then allows them to cast a different spell from the Pool\n\n4. However, this second casting would happen during the resolution of Knowledge Pool's ability, when the stack is not empty\n\n5. Because of Teferi's restriction, opponents can only cast spells when the stack is empty, which is not the case during the resolution of Knowledge Pool's ability\n\n6. Therefore, opponents cannot cast the replacement spell from Knowledge Pool\n\n7. Since the original spell is already exiled and the replacement spell cannot be cast, opponents effectively cannot cast any spells from their hand\n\n8. This creates what's known as a \"hard lock\" - opponents can still activate abilities, play lands, and take other game actions, but they cannot cast spells from their hand\n\n9. This interaction works because Teferi changes when opponents can cast spells (timing restriction), while Knowledge Pool forces all spells to be cast at a time that doesn't satisfy this restriction\n\nThis is a powerful prison combination used in formats like Modern and Commander to completely prevent opponents from casting spells, effectively locking them out of a significant portion of the game."}
{"input": "I control Life and Limb and Nature's Revolt. What creature types do forests have and what happens if one dies?", "output": "This interaction creates a complex overlay of type-changing effects. Let's analyze step by step:\n\n1. Life and Limb says: \"All Forests are 1/1 green Saproling creatures in addition to their other types. All Saprolings are Forests in addition to their other types.\"\n\n2. Nature's Revolt says: \"All lands are 2/2 creatures that are still lands.\"\n\n3. These are both type-changing effects that apply in Layer 4 of the layer system.\n\n4. When applying multiple type-changing effects, we apply them in timestamp order (the order they came under your control). Let's assume Life and Limb entered first, followed by Nature's Revolt.\n\n5. First, Life and Limb makes all Forests into Saproling creatures (and all Saprolings into Forests).\n\n6. Then, Nature's Revolt makes all lands (including the Forest Saprolings) into creatures.\n\n7. The creature types are cumulative - Forests become both creatures and lands with the Saproling creature type.\n\n8. For power and toughness, we look at Layer 7:\n   - Life and Limb sets Forests' P/T to 1/1 in Layer 7b\n   - Nature's Revolt sets lands' P/T to 2/2 in Layer 7b\n   - Since these are both P/T-setting effects in the same sublayer, the most recent timestamp wins\n   - With Nature's Revolt having the later timestamp, Forests are 2/2 creatures\n\n9. If a Forest dies (is put into the graveyard from the battlefield):\n   - Since it's a land, it triggers any \"when a land is put into a graveyard from the battlefield\" abilities\n   - Since it's a creature, it triggers any \"when a creature dies\" abilities\n   - Since it's specifically a Saproling, it triggers any \"when a Saproling dies\" abilities\n\n10. It's important to note that once a Forest leaves the battlefield, it's no longer affected by either enchantment, so in the graveyard it returns to being just a land card with the Forest subtype.\n\nTo summarize: Forests are 2/2 green land creatures with the Saproling type (and the Forest land type). When one dies, it triggers both land sacrifice and creature death triggers."}
{"input": "At the end of my opponent's turn, I want to cast Collected Company and then Chord of Calling if I don't like what I find. How does the timing and priority work?", "output": "Let's analyze how priority and timing work in this end step scenario:\n\n1. When your opponent's turn reaches the end step, first any \"at the beginning of the end step\" triggered abilities go on the stack.\n\n2. After those resolve (or if there weren't any), the active player (your opponent) receives priority first.\n\n3. If your opponent passes priority, you receive priority during the end step.\n\n4. At this point, you can cast Collected Company (an instant). The spell goes on the stack.\n\n5. After casting Collected Company, you receive priority again (not your opponent). This is a key rule: after a player adds something to the stack, that same player gets priority again.\n\n6. You can either cast another spell/activate an ability or pass priority.\n\n7. If you pass priority, then your opponent gets priority. If they also pass, Collected Company resolves.\n\n8. After Collected Company resolves, the active player (your opponent) gets priority first in the still-ongoing end step.\n\n9. If they pass priority again, you receive priority again.\n\n10. Now you can cast Chord of Calling if you wish.\n\n11. If both players pass priority without adding anything to the stack, the end step ends and the cleanup step begins (where no player normally receives priority).\n\nThe important points here are:\n\n- You can indeed cast both spells during the end step if you want\n- After Collected Company resolves, priority returns to the active player first (your opponent), not to you\n- You must wait for your opponent to pass priority again before casting Chord of Calling\n- Both spells happen in the same end step, there's no way to see what Collected Company gives you and then cast Chord of Calling in a different step/phase\n\nThis timing is significant because it means your opponent has a window to act between your spells, potentially disrupting your plans."}
{"input": "I control Jace, the Mind Sculptor with 3 loyalty counters. My opponent attacks it with a 2/2 creature, and I cast Doubling Season after blocks but before damage. How many loyalty counters will Jace have after I activate his +2 ability?", "output": "Let's analyze this planeswalker interaction step by step:\n\n1. Your Jace, the Mind Sculptor has 3 loyalty counters on it.\n\n2. Your opponent attacks Jace with a 2/2 creature, and you don't block.\n\n3. Before combat damage is dealt, you cast Doubling Season, which states: \"If an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent you control, it puts twice that many of those counters on that permanent instead.\"\n\n4. When combat damage resolves, the 2/2 creature deals 2 damage to Jace, reducing him to 1 loyalty counter.\n\n5. Later, in your main phase, you activate Jace's +2 ability, which says \"Add 2 loyalty counters to Jace, the Mind Sculptor.\"\n\n6. Doubling Season's replacement effect applies to these loyalty counters, doubling them from 2 to 4.\n\n7. Jace now has 1 (existing) + 4 (added) = 5 loyalty counters.\n\nIt's important to understand several rules points here:\n\n1. Combat damage to planeswalkers removes that many loyalty counters.\n\n2. Doubling Season affects counters being put on a permanent, not the number in the planeswalker ability's text. The ability doesn't change to \"+4\" - it's still a \"+2\" ability that results in 4 counters being added.\n\n3. Doubling Season only affects counters being placed by effects, not counters being removed.\n\n4. The cost of a planeswalker ability (adding or removing loyalty counters) is not affected by replacement effects like Doubling Season, because paying a cost is not an effect. However, in this case, Jace's +2 is adding counters as part of the ability's resolution, which is an effect.\n\nThis distinction is important: if activating the ability required you to place counters as a cost, Doubling Season wouldn't apply. But loyalty abilities add or remove counters as part of their resolution, which is an effect that Doubling Season does modify."}
{"input": "I control a token copy of Aether Spellbomb. If I bounce it to my hand with Sanctum Gargoyle's ability, then cast Karn's Temporal Sundering, can I replay the token?", "output": "This scenario involves understanding how tokens behave when they change zones. Let's analyze the sequence of events:\n\n1. You control a token copy of Aether Spellbomb (an artifact token with Aether Spellbomb's characteristics).\n\n2. You activate Sanctum Gargoyle's ability targeting the token, which returns the token to your hand.\n\n3. According to rule 111.7, \"A token that's in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist.\" This means that as soon as the token enters your hand, it immediately ceases to exist as a state-based action.\n\n4. When you cast Karn's Temporal Sundering, one of its effects gives you an extra turn. It also has the legendary sorcery rider that you must control a legendary creature or planeswalker to cast it.\n\n5. The question about replaying the token is moot because the token no longer exists. Once a token changes zones from the battlefield to any other zone, it ceases to exist immediately.\n\nKey rules concepts here:\n\n1. Tokens can be created as copies of any permanent, including artifacts like Aether Spellbomb.\n\n2. Tokens can leave the battlefield just like any other permanent.\n\n3. If a token leaves the battlefield, it goes to the next zone briefly, then ceases to exist as a state-based action.\n\n4. A token that has ceased to exist cannot be cast, retrieved, or interacted with in any way - it's simply gone.\n\n5. This applies to all tokens regardless of how they were created (copy effects, creature tokens, clues, treasures, etc.).\n\nSo, no, you cannot replay the token after it's bounced to your hand because it doesn't exist as a card in your hand - it disappeared as soon as it left the battlefield."}
{"input": "I'm at 2 life with Laboratory Maniac on the battlefield and no cards in my library. My opponent casts Shock targeting me, and in response I cast Opt. What happens?", "output": "This scenario involves an alternative win condition and a race between different state-based actions. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. You're at 2 life with Laboratory Maniac on the battlefield and 0 cards in your library.\n\n2. Laboratory Maniac has the ability: \"If you would draw a card while your library has no cards in it, you win the game instead.\"\n\n3. Your opponent casts Shock targeting you, which would deal 2 damage to you.\n\n4. In response, you cast Opt, which allows you to scry 1, then draw a card.\n\n5. The stack now has Opt on top, followed by Shock.\n\n6. Opt resolves first. You would scry 1, but since your library is empty, this has no effect.\n\n7. Opt then instructs you to draw a card. Since you have no cards in your library, Laboratory Maniac's replacement effect applies, and instead of drawing a card, you win the game.\n\n8. Since you've already won the game, Shock never gets to resolve, and your opponent never gets to deal damage to you.\n\nKey rules concepts here:\n\n1. Laboratory Maniac creates a replacement effect (\"if you would... instead\"), not a triggered ability. This means there's no opportunity for your opponent to respond once the draw effect from Opt starts resolving.\n\n2. Replacement effects happen immediately as the event they're replacing would occur.\n\n3. When a player wins or loses the game, the game ends immediately unless there are multiple players remaining (in multiplayer formats).\n\n4. State-based actions (like losing for having 0 or less life, or attempting to draw from an empty library) are only checked when a player would receive priority, not in the middle of a spell resolving.\n\nThis sequence shows how alternative win conditions can be used strategically in response to lethal threats. Had you not cast Opt in response, Shock would have resolved, and you would have lost the game for having 0 or less life before ever getting the chance to draw a card and win via Laboratory Maniac."}
{"input": "I cast Grapeshot with storm count 2, then my opponent casts Stifle targeting the storm trigger. How many copies of Grapeshot will I get?", "output": "This interaction involves understanding how storm works as a triggered ability. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. You cast Grapeshot, which has the Storm ability. Grapeshot goes on the stack.\n\n2. Storm is a triggered ability that says \"When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn.\" You've cast 2 other spells this turn, so the storm trigger goes on the stack.\n\n3. Your opponent casts Stifle targeting the storm trigger. Stifle goes on the stack above the storm trigger.\n\n4. Stifle resolves and counters the storm trigger. This means the trigger's effect (creating copies) never happens.\n\n5. The original Grapeshot is still on the stack and will resolve normally, dealing 1 damage to any target.\n\nSo you'll get exactly 0 copies of Grapeshot, but the original spell will still resolve. This means a total of 1 instance of Grapeshot (the original) will resolve, not 3 (which would have been the original plus 2 copies).\n\nKey rules concepts here:\n\n1. Storm is a triggered ability that uses the stack and can be responded to, unlike many other copy effects.\n\n2. Stifle can counter triggered abilities but not the spells themselves.\n\n3. Countering the storm trigger doesn't counter the original spell.\n\n4. Each copy of a spell created by storm is created all at once by the trigger's resolution (which is why countering the trigger prevents all copies).\n\n5. The copies are created directly on the stack - they were never cast, so they don't trigger their own storm abilities or other cast triggers.\n\nThis is why storm can be vulnerable to cards like Stifle, Squelch, or Disallow that counter triggered abilities. Had the storm trigger resolved, you would have gotten 2 copies plus the original spell, for a total of 3 instances of Grapeshot."}
{"input": "I control Kenrith, the Returned King as my commander. Can I use his red ability if Ruination is on the battlefield?", "output": "This scenario involves understanding color identity and color production restrictions in Commander. Let's analyze step by step:\n\n1. Kenrith, the Returned King is a 5-color commander (WUBRG in its casting cost).\n\n2. Kenrith has five activated abilities, each requiring a different color of mana. The red ability is \"{R}: All creatures gain trample and haste until end of turn.\"\n\n3. Ruination is a red enchantment that states: \"Players can't add mana of any color except red.\"\n\n4. In Commander, your deck's color identity is determined by all mana symbols that appear on your commander. With Kenrith as your commander, your deck's color identity includes all five colors.\n\n5. Color identity determines what cards you can include in your deck, but doesn't affect what colors of mana you can produce during the game.\n\n6. Ruination restricts all players to only producing red mana, regardless of their commander's color identity.\n\n7. Since Kenrith's red ability requires {R} (red mana), and Ruination still allows you to produce red mana, you can activate this ability.\n\n8. However, you would not be able to activate any of Kenrith's other abilities that require non-red mana while Ruination is on the battlefield.\n\nKey Commander-specific rules concepts here:\n\n1. Color identity only restricts deck construction, not mana production during the game.\n\n2. Having a 5-color commander doesn't grant immunity to effects that restrict mana production.\n\n3. Abilities of your commander are still subject to normal game rules and restrictions, including mana production limitations.\n\n4. Commander color identity is determined by all mana symbols in the casting cost, rules text, and color indicators of the commander card.\n\nSo yes, you can use Kenrith's red ability with Ruination on the battlefield, but not his white, blue, black, or green abilities unless you have a way to produce those colors despite Ruination's restriction."}
{"input": "I attack with a 1/1 creature with deathtouch, lifelink, and trample. My opponent blocks with a 3/3 creature. How much damage tramples through and how much life do I gain?", "output": "This scenario involves the interaction between deathtouch, trample, and lifelink. Let's analyze how these keywords work together:\n\n1. Deathtouch: Any amount of damage dealt by a creature with deathtouch to another creature is considered lethal damage.\n\n2. Trample: When a creature with trample attacks and is blocked, its controller assigns its combat damage such that each blocking creature is assigned at least lethal damage, and any remaining damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.\n\n3. Lifelink: Damage dealt by a creature with lifelink causes its controller to gain that much life, in addition to the damage's normal effects.\n\n4. The attack: You attack with a 1/1 creature that has all three abilities, and your opponent blocks with a 3/3.\n\n5. Normally, a 1/1 creature could not deal lethal damage to a 3/3 creature. However, because your creature has deathtouch, even 1 damage is considered lethal.\n\n6. During the combat damage step, you need to assign at least lethal damage to all blocking creatures before assigning trample damage to the player. With deathtouch, that means you only need to assign 1 damage to the blocking 3/3 creature.\n\n7. Since your creature is only a 1/1, it has exactly 1 damage to assign. This means all of its damage is assigned as lethal damage to the blocker, with 0 damage trampling over to the defending player.\n\n8. However, because your creature has lifelink, you gain life equal to the total damage dealt. In this case, 1 damage was dealt, so you gain 1 life.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Damage dealt to opponent: 0 (no trample damage)\n- Damage dealt to the 3/3 blocker: 1 (which is lethal due to deathtouch)\n- Life gained: 1 (from lifelink)\n\nIf your creature had been larger, such as a 4/4 with the same abilities, you would have assigned 1 damage to the blocker (lethal due to deathtouch) and 3 damage would trample over to the opponent, resulting in 4 life gained total."}
{"input": "It's my opponent's end step. I control Blood Artist and my opponent controls Zulaport Cutthroat. I cast Wrath of God.

On your opponent's end step, you cast Wrath of God, which destroys all creatures.\n\n2. When Wrath of God resolves, both Blood Artist and Zulaport Cutthroat are destroyed simultaneously.\n\n3. This causes both of their abilities to trigger:\n   - Blood Artist: \"Whenever Blood Artist or another creature dies, target player loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.\"\n   - Zulaport Cutthroat: \"Whenever Zulaport Cutthroat or another creature dies, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.\"\n\n4. Each creature sees itself and the other creature die, so each ability triggers twice, for a total of 4 triggered abilities.\n\n5. According to the APNAP rule (rule 603.3b), the Active Player's triggered abilities go on the stack first, followed by the Non-Active Player's triggered abilities in turn order.\n\n6. Since it's your opponent's turn, they are the Active Player. Therefore:\n   - Your opponent's Zulaport Cutthroat triggers go on the stack first (2 triggers)\n   - Then your Blood Artist triggers go on the stack (2 triggers)\n\n7. The stack resolves in reverse order (Last In, First Out):\n   - First Blood Artist trigger: You choose a target player to lose 1 life (you would typically choose your opponent) and you gain 1 life\n   - Second Blood Artist trigger: Same as above\n   - First Zulaport Cutthroat trigger: Each opponent (you) loses 1 life and your opponent gains 1 life\n   - Second Zulaport Cutthroat trigger: Same as above\n\n8.

{"input": "I cast Cryptic Command choosing to counter a spell and draw a card. My opponent responds with Sudden Shock targeting me. Can I change my modes for Cryptic Command?", "output": "This scenario involves understanding how modal spells work and when choices are made. Let's analyze:\n\n1. You cast Cryptic Command, which is a modal spell that says \"Choose two — • Counter target spell. • Return target permanent to its owner's hand. • Tap all creatures your opponents control. • Draw a card.\"\n\n2. You chose two modes: \"Counter target spell\" and \"Draw a card.\"\n\n3. As part of casting Cryptic Command, you made all required choices, including modes and targets. This happens during the casting process, before the spell ever goes on the stack and before any player receives priority.\n\n4. After these choices are made and costs are paid, the spell goes on the stack and you receive priority.\n\n5. Your opponent receives priority after you, and they cast Sudden Shock targeting you.\n\n6. According to rule 601.2c and 601.2d of the comprehensive rules, modes and targets are chosen as part of casting a spell, and once the spell becomes cast, these choices are locked in.\n\n7. There is no mechanism within the rules to change the modes of a spell after it has been cast.\n\n8. When Cryptic Command resolves, it will attempt to counter the targeted spell (if that spell is still on the stack) and will have you draw a card.\n\nKey rules concepts:\n\n1. All decisions about modes, targets, and how to pay costs are made during the casting of a spell, before it goes on the stack.\n\n2. Once a spell is cast, its modes cannot be changed, even if circumstances change.\n\n3. If a targeted mode becomes illegal (e.g., if the targeted spell is no longer on the stack), that part of the spell's effect will fail to resolve, but any legal modes will still resolve.\n\n4. Sudden Shock having split second doesn't impact this rule—you couldn't change Cryptic Command's modes regardless of what spell your opponent cast in response.\n\nSo no, you cannot change the modes of Cryptic Command after it has been cast, regardless of what happens in response."}
{"input": "I control Ajani's Pridemate, Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose, and Exquisite Blood. If I gain 1 life, what happens?", "output": "This scenario describes a classic infinite combo that creates a mandatory infinite loop. Let's analyze what happens step by step:\n\n1. You control three permanents:\n   - Ajani's Pridemate: \"Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Ajani's Pridemate.\"\n   - Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose: \"Whenever you gain life, target opponent loses that much life.\"\n   - Exquisite Blood: \"Whenever an opponent loses life, you gain that much life.\"\n\n2. The scenario begins with you gaining 1 life from some source.\n\n3. This life gain triggers both Ajani's Pridemate and Vito simultaneously.\n\n4. These triggers go on the stack in the order of your choice (since you control both).\n\n5. Let's say you put Vito's trigger on the stack first, then Ajani's Pridemate's trigger.\n\n6. Ajani's Pridemate's trigger resolves first, putting a +1/+1 counter on it.\n\n7. Then Vito's trigger resolves, causing your opponent to lose 1 life.\n\n8. Your opponent losing 1 life triggers Exquisite Blood's ability.\n\n9. Exquisite Blood's trigger resolves, causing you to gain 1 life.\n\n10. This new life gain triggers both Ajani's Pridemate and Vito again, and the process repeats.\n\nThis creates a mandatory infinite loop with no way to break it within the rules of the game. According to tournament rules (specifically rule 4.4 in the Magic Tournament Rules):\n\n1. If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw.\n\n2. Neither player can choose to stop this loop as it contains no optional actions.\n\n3. In casual play, players might agree to shortcut to a specific outcome (e.g., \"I gain infinite life, my opponent loses infinite life, and Ajani's Pridemate gets infinitely large\").\n\n4. In tournament play, this would officially result in a draw unless one player has a way to break the loop.\n\nThe reason this is a mandatory loop is because none of the triggered abilities contain the word \"may\" - they all trigger and resolve automatically whenever their trigger condition is met. If any of these abilities were optional (e.g., if Vito said \"you may have target opponent lose that much life\"), then the loop could be broken by choosing not to apply that effect."}
