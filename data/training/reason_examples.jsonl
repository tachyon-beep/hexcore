{"input": "Given that I control Tarmogoyf and my opponent casts Lightning Bolt targeting it, what happens if there are no instants in any graveyard before Lightning Bolt resolves?", "output": "When your opponent casts Lightning Bolt targeting your Tarmogoyf, we need to analyze the sequence of events carefully:\n\n1. Lightning Bolt is cast, targeting Tarmogoyf.\n2. Lightning Bolt is on the stack, but has not yet resolved.\n3. At this point, we check Tarmogoyf's toughness, which depends on the card types in all graveyards.\n4. You mentioned there are no instants in any graveyard before Lightning Bolt resolves.\n5. When Lightning Bolt resolves, it will deal 3 damage to Tarmogoyf.\n6. Then, Lightning Bolt will go to the graveyard as part of the resolution.\n7. At this point, there is now an instant (Lightning Bolt) in a graveyard.\n\nHowever, by the time Lightning Bolt has finished resolving and is in the graveyard, the 3 damage has already been dealt to Tarmogoyf based on its toughness before the instant entered the graveyard. The damage doesn't retroactively change.\n\nSo if Tarmogoyf's toughness was 3 or greater before Lightning Bolt resolved, it would survive. If its toughness was 2 or less, it would die before Lightning Bolt entering the graveyard could increase its toughness."}
{"input": "I control a Phyrexian Metamorph copying a Sakura-Tribe Elder. My opponent plays Humility. What does the Metamorph look like now?", "output": "Let's analyze this step by step based on dependency and timestamp principles in MTG's layer system:\n\n1. Phyrexian Metamorph was copying Sakura-Tribe Elder, making it a 1/1 green Snake Shaman with the sacrifice ability to search for a basic land.\n\n2. Humility enters the battlefield with a newer timestamp. Humility creates a continuous effect that sets creatures' base power and toughness to 1/1 and removes all abilities from creatures.\n\n3. When applying continuous effects, we follow the layer system:\n   - Layer 1 (Copy effects): Metamorph's copy effect is applied first, making it a copy of Sakura-Tribe Elder\n   - Layer 6 (Ability adding/removing effects): Humility removes all abilities from creatures, including the Metamorph's copied abilities\n   - Layer 7b (P/T setting effects): Humility sets base P/T to 1/1\n\nSo the final state of Phyrexian Metamorph would be:\n- It's still a green Snake Shaman (creature types are preserved)\n- It has power and toughness 1/1 (set by Humility)\n- It has no abilities (removed by Humility)\n\nThe Metamorph essentially becomes a vanilla 1/1 green Snake Shaman with no abilities."}
{"input": "If I control Chalice of the Void with one counter on it and cast Chalice of the Void for X=2, will the first Chalice counter the second?", "output": "No, the first Chalice of the Void with one counter on it will not counter the second Chalice that you cast for X=2.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Chalice of the Void has the ability: \"Whenever a player casts a spell with converted mana cost/mana value equal to the number of charge counters on Chalice of the Void, counter that spell.\"\n\n2. When you cast the second Chalice of the Void with X=2, its mana value on the stack is determined by its casting cost. The mana value of a spell with X in its cost includes the value chosen for X while the spell is on the stack.\n\n3. So, the second Chalice of the Void has a mana value of 2 + 2 = 4 (two mana for X=2, plus the base cost of 2).\n\n4. The first Chalice of the Void has one counter on it, so it only counters spells with mana value 1.\n\n5. Since the second Chalice has a mana value of 4 on the stack, not 1, the first Chalice will not trigger to counter it.\n\nTherefore, the second Chalice of the Void will resolve successfully, entering the battlefield with 2 charge counters."}
{"input": "I control Hinata, Dawn-Crowned. If I cast Urza's Rage with kicker, how much mana do I need to pay?", "output": "To determine how much mana you need to pay for Urza's Rage with kicker while controlling Hinata, Dawn-Crowned, we need to understand the interaction between cost reduction and kicker costs.\n\nHinata, Dawn-Crowned says: \"Spells you cast that target one or more creatures or planeswalkers cost {1} less to cast for each creature and/or planeswalker they target.\"\n\nUrza's Rage is an instant with a cost of {2}{R} that deals 3 damage to any target. It also has a kicker cost of {8}{R}. When kicked, it deals 10 damage instead and can't be countered by spells or abilities.\n\nSince Urza's Rage targets exactly one permanent (could be a creature or planeswalker in this case), it gets a {1} discount from Hinata.\n\nSo the calculations are:\n\n1. Base cost of Urza's Rage: {2}{R}\n2. Discount from Hinata: {1}\n3. Base cost after discount: {1}{R}\n4. Kicker cost: {8}{R} (the kicker cost is not reduced by Hinata as it's an additional cost, not part of the original cost that gets reduced)\n\nTotal cost to cast Urza's Rage with kicker: {1}{R} + {8}{R} = {9}{R}{R} or 11 mana total (9 generic, 2 red).\n\nNote: If Urza's Rage targeted a non-creature, non-planeswalker permanent or a player, Hinata would provide no discount."}
{"input": "If I control Darien, King of Kjeldor and play Mana Crypt, what happens if I lose the coin flip during my upkeep?", "output": "Here's the sequence of events that occurs when you control Darien, King of Kjeldor and play Mana Crypt, then lose the coin flip during your upkeep:\n\n1. During your upkeep, Mana Crypt's ability triggers, forcing you to flip a coin.\n\n2. If you lose the flip, Mana Crypt deals 3 damage to you.\n\n3. When you take damage, Darien, King of Kjeldor's ability triggers. Darien's ability states: \"Whenever you're dealt damage, you may create that many 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens.\"\n\n4. Since you were dealt 3 damage, Darien's ability allows you to create 3 white 1/1 Soldier tokens.\n\nSo the net result is:\n- You take 3 damage from Mana Crypt\n- You create 3 white 1/1 Soldier creature tokens\n\nThis interaction can be quite beneficial despite taking damage, as you're effectively converting the damage into creature tokens, which can be valuable for building a board presence or for other effects that care about creatures entering the battlefield."}
{"input": "If I control The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale and my opponent controls Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, how much do I have to pay to keep my creatures?", "output": "This interaction involves understanding how multiple taxation effects work together.\n\nThe Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale gives all creatures an ability that says \"At the beginning of your upkeep, destroy this creature unless you pay {1}.\" This means each player must pay {1} for each creature they control during their upkeep or those creatures will be destroyed.\n\nThalia, Guardian of Thraben has the static ability: \"Noncreature spells cost {1} more to cast.\" However, this ability only affects the casting of noncreature spells and has no effect on activated or triggered abilities.\n\nThe upkeep cost from The Tabernacle is a triggered ability, not a spell being cast. Therefore, Thalia's tax does not apply to this payment.\n\nSo, you would still only need to pay {1} for each creature you control during your upkeep to satisfy The Tabernacle's requirement, regardless of your opponent controlling Thalia.\n\nNote that if YOU controlled Thalia, it wouldn't change this interaction either, as again, Thalia only affects noncreature spells, not triggered ability payments."}
{"input": "If I have Yawgmoth's Will and cast a spell from my graveyard, what happens if my opponent counters it?", "output": "When you have Yawgmoth's Will and cast a spell from your graveyard that gets countered, here's what happens:\n\n1. Yawgmoth's Will lets you play cards from your graveyard this turn, with the additional rule that if a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile it instead.\n\n2. When you cast a spell from your graveyard, it moves from the graveyard to the stack (just like when casting from hand).\n\n3. Your opponent counters the spell while it's on the stack.\n\n4. Normally, a countered spell would go to its owner's graveyard.\n\n5. However, because of Yawgmoth's Will's replacement effect, instead of going to your graveyard, the countered spell is exiled.\n\nThe key point here is that once you've cast the spell from your graveyard, it's no longer in the graveyard - it's on the stack. When countered, it would normally return to the graveyard, but Yawgmoth's Will exiles it instead.\n\nThis means you can't cast that specific card again this turn, even with Yawgmoth's Will still active, because the card is now in exile, not in your graveyard."}
{"input": "I control Containment Priest and my opponent activates Sneak Attack to put Emrakul, the Aeons Torn into play. What happens?", "output": "Let's analyze this interaction step by step:\n\n1. Containment Priest has the ability: \"If a nontoken creature would enter the battlefield and it wasn't cast, exile it instead.\"\n\n2. Sneak Attack has the ability: \"Pay {R}: You may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. That creature gains haste. Sacrifice the creature at the beginning of the next end step.\"\n\n3. Your opponent activates Sneak Attack, paying {R} and choosing to put Emrakul, the Aeons Torn from their hand onto the battlefield.\n\n4. This would cause Emrakul to enter the battlefield without being cast, which triggers Containment Priest's replacement effect.\n\n5. Instead of entering the battlefield, Emrakul is exiled.\n\n6. Since Emrakul never enters the battlefield, the delayed triggered ability from Sneak Attack that would cause it to be sacrificed at the beginning of the next end step doesn't create a trigger because the creature it's tracking never existed on the battlefield.\n\n7. Emrakul, the Aeons Torn has its own triggered ability: \"When Emrakul is put into a graveyard from anywhere, its owner shuffles their graveyard into their library.\" However, this ability doesn't trigger because Emrakul is being put into exile, not into a graveyard.\n\nSo, the end result is that Emrakul is exiled and stays there. Your opponent spent {R} for no benefit, and Emrakul doesn't enter the battlefield, doesn't gain haste, doesn't get sacrificed later, and doesn't trigger its graveyard shuffle ability."}
{"input": "I control Dauthi Voidwalker and Blood Moon. My opponent plays Scalding Tarn and cracks it. What happens?", "output": "Let's analyze this complex interaction step by step:\n\n1. You control Dauthi Voidwalker, which has the ability: \"If a card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it with a void counter on it instead.\"\n\n2. You also control Blood Moon, which states: \"Nonbasic lands are Mountains.\"\n\n3. Your opponent plays Scalding Tarn, which would normally be a nonbasic land with a fetch ability, but because of Blood Moon, it enters the battlefield as a Mountain instead.\n\n4. As a Mountain, Scalding Tarn loses all its original abilities (including the fetch ability to sacrifice it to search for a land) and gains \"{T}: Add {R}\".\n\n5. When your opponent attempts to \"crack\" it (i.e., activate its sacrifice ability to search for a land), they cannot do so because that ability doesn't exist while Blood Moon is in effect.\n\nIn summary, your opponent cannot activate Scalding Tarn's fetch ability at all. It's simply a Mountain with the tap ability to add red mana. The interaction with Dauthi Voidwalker's replacement effect never comes into play because the situation where Scalding Tarn would go to the graveyard doesn't arise."}
