"input": "I control a Voice of Resurgence and a Rest in Peace. If Voice of Resurgence dies, do I get an Elemental token?",
"output": "If you control both Voice of Resurgence and Rest in Peace, and Voice of Resurgence dies, you do not get an Elemental token. Here's why:\r\n\r\n    Rest in Peace replaces any event that would put a card or token into a graveyard, exiling it instead.\r\n\r\n    For a creature to \"die,\" it must be put into a graveyard from the battlefield (rule 700.4). Since Rest in Peace exiles Voice of Resurgence instead, it never reaches the graveyard.\r\n\r\n    Because the Voice was exiled, the \"when this dies\" trigger never occurs, as the condition (moving to the graveyard) was replaced.\r\n\r\nResult: No Elemental token is created.",
"reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is, if I control a Voice of Resurgence and a Rest in Peace, and the Voice dies, do I get an Elemental token?\r\n\r\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these cards does. Voice of Resurgence is a creature that, when it dies, creates a token. Specifically, the ability says something like \"whenever Voice of Resurgence dies, create a token that's a certain size, maybe X\/X where X is the number of creatures that died this turn. Wait, no, actually, I think Voice of Resurgence's death trigger creates a token whose power and toughness are equal to the number of creatures your opponents control. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me check.\r\n\r\nWait, Voice of Resurgence has two abilities. The first one is a triggered ability whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn, you create a 1\/1 white and green Elemental creature token. The second ability is when Voice of Resurgence dies, you create a token with power and toughness equal to the number of creatures you control. Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing it with another card. Let me recall correctly. Voice of Resurgence's ability is: Whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn, create a 1\/1 white and green Elemental creature token. And the second ability is when Voice of Resurgence dies, create a X\/X white and green Elemental creature token, where X is the number of creatures you control. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Let me check again.\r\n\r\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing it with another card. Voice of Resurgence actually has a death trigger that creates a token with power and toughness each equal to the number of creatures that died that turn. Wait, maybe that's not correct either. Let me get this straight. Voice of Resurgence is from Dragon's Maze. Its text is: Whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn, create a 1\/1 white and green Elemental creature token. When Voice of Resurgence dies, create a X\/X white and green Elemental creature token, where X is the number of creatures you control. No, wait, that's not right. Let me check the actual card text.\r\n\r\nOkay, the actual text of Voice of Resurgence is: Whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn, create a 1\/1 white and green Elemental creature token. When Voice of Resurgence dies, create a X\/X white and green Elemental creature token, where X is the number of creatures you control. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me look up the exact wording. Oh right, the correct text is: Whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn, create a 1\/1 white and green Elemental creature token. When Voice of Resurgence dies, create a white and green Elemental creature token with \"This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.\"\r\n\r\nSo when Voice of Resurgence dies, the token's power and toughness are equal to the number of creatures you control at the time the token is created. Now, Rest in Peace is an enchantment that says \"When Rest in Peace enters the battlefield, exile all graveyards. If a card or token would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.\"\r\n\r\nSo the interaction here is that when Voice of Resurgence dies, it would normally go to the graveyard, but Rest in Peace replaces that with exiling it instead. However, Voice's ability triggers when it dies, regardless of where it's going. So the death trigger still happens even though it's exiled instead of put into the graveyard. Because the trigger is \"whenever dies\", which means when it's put into the graveyard from the battlefield, but Rest in Peace replaces that with exiling. However, in Magic, replacement effects modify how an event happens, but the event is still considered to have happened. So when a creature dies, it's moving from the battlefield to the graveyard. If Rest in Peace is out, it gets exiled instead, but the game still sees that the creature died (since dying is defined as being put into the graveyard from the battlefield). However, because of Rest in Peace, the actual destination is exile. But the game still checks for \"dies\" triggers, because the event that caused the trigger was the creature moving from battlefield to graveyard, even though it's replaced. So Voice's death trigger will still happen. Therefore, even though Voice is exiled, the trigger occurs, and you create the Elemental token.\r\n\r\nWait, but there's a nuance here. Let me make sure. The rule is that a creature \"dies\" if it is put into a graveyard from the battlefield. If a replacement effect exiles it instead, does the game still consider it to have died? The answer is no, because the game uses the actual result after replacement effects to determine if the event occurred. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check the comprehensive rules.\r\n\r\nRule 700.4: The term dies means \"is put into a graveyard from the battlefield.\" So, if a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it dies. If a replacement effect (like Rest in Peace) exiles it instead, then it's not put into the graveyard, so it doesn't die. Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. So if a replacement effect exiles the creature instead of putting it into the graveyard, then it never actually dies, because dying requires being put into the graveyard. Therefore, the death trigger wouldn't happen.\r\n\r\nWait, that's a key point. So if Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, and a creature would die (be put into the graveyard from the battlefield), Rest in Peace replaces that with exiling it. Therefore, the creature never actually dies, because it was never put into the graveyard. Therefore, any \"when this creature dies\" triggers wouldn't trigger, because the event that causes them (being put into the graveyard) didn't happen.\r\n\r\nBut wait, I thought that replacement effects don't stop the original event from being checked for triggers. Let me think. For example, if you have a creature with a \"when this creature dies\" trigger and it's exiled instead, does the trigger still happen? The answer is no, because the creature didn't die; it was exiled. So the death trigger doesn't occur.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this scenario, if Voice of Resurgence dies while Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, it would be exiled instead of going to the graveyard, so it doesn't die, so its death trigger doesn't happen. Therefore, you don't get the Elemental token.\r\n\r\nWait, but I'm confused because I remember some interactions where replacement effects don't prevent triggers. Let me check an example. If a creature has an ability that triggers when it's put into the graveyard from anywhere, and it's exiled instead, then that ability wouldn't trigger because the event was replaced. Similarly, if a creature dies, but is exiled instead, then it didn't die, so death triggers don't happen.\r\n\r\nSo in this case, Voice's death trigger is \"When Voice of Resurgence dies\", which is shorthand for \"when Voice of Resurgence is put into a graveyard from the battlefield\". If it's exiled instead, then that event didn't happen, so the trigger doesn't occur. Therefore, you don't get the token.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's another angle. Let me check the exact wording of Rest in Peace. It says, \"If a card or token would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.\" So when Voice of Resurgence dies, which is being put into the graveyard from the battlefield, Rest in Peace replaces that with exiling it. The key is that the event of moving to the graveyard is replaced, so the creature never actually moves there. Therefore, the \"when this dies\" trigger doesn't happen because the creature didn't die.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this scenario, the controller of Voice of Resurgence would not get the Elemental token when Voice dies while Rest in Peace is on the battlefield."
