"output": "When your opponent activates Sneak Attack to put Emrakul, the Aeons Torn onto the battlefield while you control Containment Priest, the following occurs:\r\n\r\n    Containment Priest's Replacement Effect:\r\n    Containment Priest replaces the event of Emrakul entering the battlefield with exile. Since Sneak Attack does not cast Emrakul (it puts it directly onto the battlefield), Containment Priest exiles Emrakul instead.\r\n\r\n    Consequences for Sneak Attack:\r\n    Emrakul never enters the battlefield, so:\r\n\r\n        Sneak Attack's delayed sacrifice trigger (at the next end step) does not apply, as the creature was never on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n        Emrakul's \"when cast\" ability (extra turn) does not trigger, as it wasn't cast.\r\n\r\n        Emrakul's \"put into a graveyard from anywhere\" ability does not trigger, as it was exiled, not sent to the graveyard.\r\n\r\n    Result:\r\n    Emrakul is exiled permanently. Your opponent expends the resources (paying Sneak Attack's activation cost and discarding Emrakul) but gains no benefit from Emrakul's abilities or combat.\r\n\r\nSummary: Emrakul is exiled by Containment Priest, and your opponent receives no extra turns or other effects from Emrakul.",
"reasoning": "Okay, so here's the situation: I control Containment Priest, and my opponent uses Sneak Attack to put Emrakul, the Aeons Torn into play. What happens here? Let me break this down.\r\n\r\nFirst, I need to remember what each card does. Containment Priest is a creature that has an ability: \"If a creature would enter the battlefield and it wasn't cast, exile it instead.\" So any creature that enters without being cast gets exiled. Sneak Attack is an enchantment that lets you pay R and discard a card to put a creature from your hand onto the battlefield. It gains haste, but you have to sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step. And Emrakul is a big Eldrazi with annihilator 6, protection from colored spells, and when it's put into the graveyard from anywhere, you take an extra turn. But importantly, Emrakul has a clause that says when you cast it, you take an extra turn after this one. But in this case, they're not casting Emrakul, they're using Sneak Attack to put it into play.\r\n\r\nSo the opponent activates Sneak Attack's ability, paying R and discarding a card to put Emrakul onto the battlefield. But I have Containment Priest in play. So when they try to put Emrakul into play via Sneak Attack, which doesn't involve casting it, the Priest's ability should trigger. So Emrakul would be exiled instead of entering the battlefield. But wait, Sneak Attack's effect says to put the creature onto the battlefield, but the Priest's replacement effect exiles it instead. So Emrakul never actually hits the battlefield. Then, what about the Sneak Attack's sacrifice clause? If the creature is exiled instead, does it still get sacrificed? Probably not, because the creature never entered the battlefield. So Emrakul is just exiled, right?\r\n\r\nBut wait, let me confirm the layers here. Replacement effects apply as the event is happening. So when Sneak Attack's ability resolves, it tries to put Emrakul onto the battlefield. Containment Priest's ability is a replacement effect that exiles it instead. So Emrakul is exiled. Since it never entered the battlefield, Sneak Attack's delayed trigger (sacrifice it at end step) never gets set up, because the creature was never on the battlefield to begin with. So the opponent doesn't get to attack with Emrakul, and Emrakul is just in exile. Also, since Emrakul was never on the battlefield, its triggered ability when cast (extra turn) doesn't happen because it wasn't cast. Additionally, Emrakul's ability when it's put into the graveyard from anywhere doesn't trigger here either because it was exiled, not put into the graveyard. So the opponent doesn't get any extra turns, and Emrakul is just stuck in exile. That seems to be the case. So the end result is Emrakul is exiled, no triggers from Emrakul, no extra turn, and the opponent just loses that card and the resources spent activating Sneak Attack. That seems right. But I should double-check if there are any interactions I'm missing here. For example, does Containment Priest's ability work even if the creature has protection or other abilities? Since Containment Priest's ability is a replacement effect, it doesn't target, so protection doesn't matter. So even though Emrakul has protection from colored spells, that doesn't stop the Priest's ability from exiling it. Yeah, because protection stops targeting, damage, blocking, etc., but a replacement effect that exiles doesn't target. So the Priest's effect would still apply. Therefore, the end result is Emrakul is exiled, no extra turns, and Sneak Attack's effect fizzles because the creature never entered the battlefield. So the answer is that Emrakul is exiled instead of entering the battlefield, and the opponent doesn't get to keep it or get any of its triggered abilities."
