"input": "I control Dauthi Voidwalker and Blood Moon. My opponent plays Scalding Tarn and cracks it. What happens?",
"output": "When your opponent plays Scalding Tarn and attempts to crack it under the effects of your Dauthi Voidwalker and Blood Moon, the following occurs:\r\n\r\n    Scalding Tarn Enters the Battlefield:\r\n\r\n        Blood Moon's static ability immediately turns Scalding Tarn into a Mountain with the subtype Mountain. It loses all its original abilities, including the activated ability to sacrifice and search for a land.\r\n\r\n    Attempting to Activate Scalding Tarn's Ability:\r\n\r\n        Since Scalding Tarn is now a Mountain with no abilities, your opponent cannot activate its original ability. The game does not allow them to pay costs or activate nonexistent abilities.\r\n\r\n    Result of the Attempt:\r\n\r\n        The sacrifice and search do not occur. Scalding Tarn remains on the battlefield as a Mountain. No cards are put into your opponent's graveyard, so Dauthi Voidwalker has no effect here.\r\n\r\nFinal Outcome:\r\nScalding Tarn enters as a Mountain, and your opponent cannot activate its ability. The land stays on the battlefield, and no cards are searched, moved to the graveyard, or exiled.",
"reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out what happens here. So the scenario is that I control Dauthi Voidwalker and Blood Moon. My opponent plays Scalding Tarn and cracks it. I need to determine what happens step by step.\r\n\r\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these cards does. Dauthi Voidwalker is a creature with a static ability that says \"If a card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.\" It also has an ability that lets me play cards exiled with it by spending mana as though it were any color, but that might not be relevant here. Then Blood Moon is an enchantment that turns all nonbasic lands into Mountains. So Scalding Tarn is a nonbasic land, so under Blood Moon, it becomes a Mountain. But wait, when does Blood Moon apply? Blood Moon's effect is a static ability that changes the land's types, so as soon as Blood Moon is on the battlefield, all nonbasic lands lose their original abilities and become Mountains. So Scalding Tarn, once Blood Moon is out, is just a Mountain with no abilities.\r\n\r\nNow, the opponent plays Scalding Tarn. When they play it, it's a land, so it enters the battlefield. But as soon as it does, Blood Moon's effect applies, so it becomes a Mountain. That means it loses all its original abilities, including the ability to be sacrificed to search for a land. But wait, the opponent is cracking Scalding Tarn, which means they are activating its ability. But if Blood Moon is in play, Scalding Tarn is a Mountain with no abilities. So activating its ability isn't possible because it doesn't have that ability anymore. Wait, but when do they crack it? If they play Scalding Tarn, and then immediately crack it, but Blood Moon is already in play, then Scalding Tarn is a Mountain with no abilities. So when they try to activate the ability, it's not there. So the ability can't be activated. Therefore, cracking Scalding Tarn does nothing, right?\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's another angle. The original ability of Scalding Tarn is \"{T}, Pay 1 life, Sacrifice Scalding Tarn: Search your library for an Island or Mountain card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle.\" So when they crack it, they sacrifice it as part of the cost. But if Blood Moon is turning it into a Mountain, then it loses all its abilities. So if they try to activate the ability, they can't because the ability is gone. But when do they activate it? Let's think about priority. When the opponent plays Scalding Tarn, it enters the battlefield. Then Blood Moon's effect applies, making it a Mountain. Then the opponent has priority, and they can activate abilities. But since Scalding Tarn is now a Mountain without any abilities, they can't activate the original ability. Therefore, they can't crack it. So they can't sacrifice it to search. Therefore, the attempt to crack it would do nothing, right?\r\n\r\nBut maybe there's a timing thing here. If they play Scalding Tarn and, in response to Blood Moon's effect, they try to crack it before it becomes a Mountain. Wait, no. Blood Moon is a static ability that's applied continuously. There's no priority involved here. As soon as Scalding Tarn enters the battlefield, it's a Mountain. So the opponent can't respond to it becoming a Mountain. So when they play it, it enters as a Mountain. Then, if they want to activate its ability, they can't because it's already a Mountain with no abilities. Therefore, they can't activate the ability. So cracking Scalding Tarn does nothing. But wait, maybe they can activate the ability before Blood Moon applies? No, because Blood Moon is already on the battlefield. When Scalding Tarn enters, it checks for Blood Moon immediately. There's no window to activate abilities before it becomes a Mountain. So they can't crack it.\r\n\r\nBut let's confirm the layers. Blood Moon affects layer 4, changing the land's types. So all nonbasic lands are Mountains. So Scalding Tarn is a Mountain. Therefore, it loses all abilities except for the mana ability (but Mountains have \"{T}: Add {R}\"). But Scalding Tarn's original ability isn't a mana ability because it requires sacrificing the land and paying life, which is a cost. So the original ability is an activated ability, not a mana ability. Since Blood Moon removes all abilities except for the basic land types, Scalding Tarn loses its activated ability. Therefore, the opponent can't activate it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when the opponent cracks Scalding Tarn, they can't activate the ability, so they can't sacrifice it, and nothing happens. But wait, the question says they crack it. Maybe they try to, but the ability isn't there. So the game would not allow them to activate it. So the activation is impossible. Therefore, nothing happens. But what if they try to do it anyway? Well, in a real game, a player can't activate abilities that aren't there. So the opponent can't activate Scalding Tarn's ability because it's a Mountain without that ability.\r\n\r\nSo the outcome is that Scalding Tarn enters as a Mountain, the opponent can't activate its ability, so cracking it does nothing. Then, since they can't sacrifice it, they don't search their library, and no card is put into the graveyard. Therefore, Dauthi Voidwalker's ability doesn't trigger because no card was going to the graveyard. So the result is that Scalding Tarn becomes a Mountain, the opponent can't crack it, so it stays on the battlefield as a Mountain, and nothing else happens.\r\n\r\nWait, but if they do manage to activate the ability (somehow), then sacrificing it would put it into the graveyard. But under Dauthi Voidwalker, it would be exiled instead. But since they can't activate the ability in the first place, that's moot. So the key points are Blood Moon turns Scalding Tarn into a Mountain with no abilities, so the opponent can't crack it. Therefore, the attempted activation is impossible, so nothing happens. So the answer is that Scalding Tarn enters as a Mountain, and when the opponent tries to crack it, they can't, so it remains on the battlefield, and no cards are searched or put into graveyards, so Dauthi Voidwalker doesn't exile anything."
