  "input": "I control a Phyrexian Metamorph copying a Sakura-Tribe Elder. My opponent plays Humility. What does the Metamorph look like now?",
  "output": "The Phyrexian Metamorph will end up as a 1\/1 green Artifact Creature with no abilities after Humility enters the battlefield. Here's the breakdown:\r\n\r\n    Copy Effect (Layer 1):\r\n    The Metamorph enters as a copy of Sakura-Tribe Elder, becoming a green Creature (with its sacrifice ability) and retaining its Artifact type (as per Metamorph's text). Its base P\/T is 1\/1.\r\n\r\n    Humility's Effects (Layers 6 and 7):\r\n\r\n        Abilities Removed (Layer 6): All creatures lose all abilities. The Metamorph loses the Elder's sacrifice ability.\r\n\r\n        P\/T Set to 1\/1 (Layer 7): While the copied Elder was already 1\/1, Humility explicitly sets its P\/T to 1\/1 regardless of other effects.\r\n\r\n    Final State:\r\n\r\n        Color: Green (copied from Sakura-Tribe Elder).\r\n\r\n        Types: Artifact Creature (Metamorph's copy effect adds Artifact).\r\n\r\n        Abilities: None (removed by Humility).\r\n\r\n        Power\/Toughness: 1\/1 (set by Humility).\r\n\r\nThus, the Metamorph becomes a green 1\/1 Artifact Creature with no abilities.\r\n",
  "reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about Phyrexian Metamorph copying Sakura-Tribe Elder and then Humility is played. What does the Metamorph become?\r\n\r\nFirst, I need to recall what each card does. Phyrexian Metamorph is an artifact creature that can enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact or creature. So when it enters, it copies Sakura-Tribe Elder, which is a creature. So the Metamorph becomes a copy of Sakura-Tribe Elder, right? So it's a 1\/1 creature with the ability to sacrifice itself to search for a basic land.\r\n\r\nThen Humility comes into play. Humility says all creatures lose all abilities and are 1\/1. So how do these layers work here? Because the Metamorph is copying Sakura-Tribe Elder, but then Humility is affecting its power\/toughness and abilities.\r\n\r\nWait, but layers. Layer order is important here. Copy effects are in layer 1, and then ability-adding or removing effects are in layer 6, and power\/toughness setting is in layer 7. So first, the Metamorph copies the Elder in layer 1. Then, Humility applies in layer 6 to remove all abilities, and layer 7 to set power\/toughness to 1\/1.\r\n\r\nBut wait, does Humility affect the copy effect? Because Humility's effect applies after the copy effect. So when you copy something, you take its base characteristics, then apply other effects. So the Metamorph is first a copy of Sakura-Tribe Elder, then Humility makes it a 1\/1 with no abilities. So even though the original Elder has a 1\/1 body, the Metamorph would become a 1\/1 with no abilities, right?\r\n\r\nBut wait, Humility also removes abilities. So even if the Metamorph copied the Elder's ability, Humility would take it away. So regardless of what it copied, once Humility is on the battlefield, all creatures have no abilities and are 1\/1. So the Metamorph would be a 1\/1 colorless creature with no abilities, because Humility overrides those aspects. But wait, the Metamorph is also an artifact because it's originally an artifact. So even though it copies a creature (Sakura-Tribe Elder), the copy effect includes the types, but the artifact part is from Metamorph's own text. Wait, no. Wait, Phyrexian Metamorph says \"You may have Phyrexian Metamorph enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact or creature on the battlefield...\" So when it copies something, it becomes a copy of that permanent, except it's also an artifact in addition to its other types. Wait, no. Wait, the wording is \"as a copy\", so it copies the artifact or creature, but the Metamorph's own text says it's an artifact in addition to its other types. Wait, let me check the exact wording.\r\n\r\nPhyrexian Metamorph's oracle text says: \"You may have Phyrexian Metamorph enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact or creature on the battlefield, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types.\" So when it copies Sakura-Tribe Elder, which is a creature, it becomes a copy of that creature, but also an artifact. So normally, it's a Sakura-Tribe Elder plus artifact. Then Humility is played. Humility says all creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1\/1. So the Metamorph is a creature (since it copied a creature) and an artifact. So Humility affects it. So first, the Metamorph is a copy of Sakura-Tribe Elder, which is a 1\/1 with that ability, and also an artifact. Then Humility makes all creatures 1\/1 with no abilities. So the Metamorph would lose the ability from Sakura-Tribe Elder, and its power and toughness become 1\/1. But wait, wasn't the original Sakura-Tribe Elder already 1\/1? So even after copying, the Metamorph is a 1\/1, but then Humility sets it to 1\/1 again. But does that matter? Not really. But the key point is that it's an artifact creature that's 1\/1 with no abilities.\r\n\r\nWait, but the Metamorph's copy effect is in layer 1. Then, any effects that modify power\/toughness or remove abilities are applied in later layers. So the copy effect makes it a Sakura-Tribe Elder artifact creature (since Metamorph adds artifact to the types). Then Humility applies in layer 6 to remove abilities, and layer 7 to set P\/T. So the end result is a 1\/1 artifact creature with no abilities.\r\n\r\nSo the answer should be that Phyrexian Metamorph becomes a 1\/1 colorless Artifact Creature with no abilities. Because even though it copied the Elder's green color, Humility doesn't affect color, right? Wait, does Humility affect color? No. Humility only affects abilities and P\/T. So the Metamorph would retain any colors from the copied creature unless something else changes it. Wait, the original Sakura-Tribe Elder is green. So the Metamorph copies it, so it's green. Then Humility doesn't affect color. So the Metamorph would be a green artifact creature, 1\/1, with no abilities. But wait, the Metamorph's copy effect says it's an artifact in addition to its other types. So the Metamorph is a green artifact creature. Then Humility makes it 1\/1 and removes abilities. So the final result is a green artifact creature, 1\/1, no abilities. But wait, the original Metamorph is colorless, but when it copies something, it copies the colors of the original. So since Sakura-Tribe Elder is green, the Metamorph becomes green. So even though the Metamorph is an artifact, it's green. So after Humility, it's a green artifact creature, 1\/1, no abilities. But the question is, what does it look like? So color, types, P\/T, abilities.\r\n\r\nBut wait, does Humility remove the artifact type? No. Humility only affects creatures, making them lose abilities and be 1\/1. The artifact type is from the copy effect. So the Metamorph is still an artifact creature. So the answer should be that the Metamorph is a 1\/1 green Artifact Creature with no abilities. But wait, wait. Let me double-check.\r\n\r\nPhyrexian Metamorph's copy effect: it copies the target artifact or creature, except it's also an artifact. So if you copy a green creature (Sakura-Tribe Elder), the Metamorph becomes a green artifact creature. Then Humility affects all creatures, so it removes all abilities and sets P\/T to 1\/1. Since the original Sakura-Tribe Elder is a 1\/1, the copy would also be 1\/1, but Humility sets it to 1\/1 regardless. So the P\/T is still 1\/1, but the color is green, types are artifact and creature, and no abilities. So the Metamorph is a green 1\/1 artifact creature with no abilities.\r\n\r\nBut wait, wait, does the copy effect copy the color? Yes. Because when you copy a creature, you copy its colors. Unless the copy effect specifies otherwise. Phyrexian Metamorph's copy effect doesn't change the color; it just adds artifact to the types. So the color is green. So the final result is a green artifact creature, 1\/1, no abilities.\r\n\r\nBut I need to confirm. Let's check layer 1: copy effect. Layer 5: color changes? No. So the color is determined by the copy effect. Then layer 6: abilities removed by Humility. Layer 7: P\/T set to 1\/1. So yes, the Metamorph is green, artifact creature, 1\/1, no abilities. So the answer is that the Metamorph is a green 1\/1 artifact creature with no abilities."
