# Development Environment Setup Checklist

Here's a detailed checklist for setting up our development environment for the MTG AI Reasoning Assistant project:

## Repository Setup & Structure
- [x] Initialize Git repository (already completed)
- [X] Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [X] Add .gitignore file for Python, PyTorch, and other ML frameworks
- [X] Create initial directory structure:
  - [X] `/src` - core codebase
  - [X] `/data` - data processing scripts and storage
  - [X] `/models` - model weights and adapters
  - [X] `/notebooks` - experimental Jupyter notebooks
  - [X] `/tests` - unit and integration tests
  - [X] `/docs` - documentation files
- [X] Add LICENSE file

## Environment Configuration
- [x] Create conda environment (already completed)
- [-] Create requirements.txt with core dependencies:
  - [ ] torch>=2.0.0
  - [ ] transformers>=4.34.0
  - [ ] peft>=0.5.0
  - [ ] bitsandbytes>=0.41.0
  - [ ] accelerate>=0.23.0
  - [ ] flash-attn>=2.3.0
  - [ ] networkx>=3.1
  - [ ] faiss-gpu>=1.7.2
  - [ ] sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
- [X] Create environment.yml as alternate to requirements.txt
- [-] Add setup script for easy environment configuration

## GPU & Hardware Setup
- [ ] Create GPU detection and configuration script
- [ ] Implement memory monitoring utilities
- [ ] Setup CUDA configuration for optimal performance
- [ ] Create device mapping utility for tensor parallelism
- [ ] Add fallbacks for different GPU configurations

## Development Tools
- [ ] Configure VS Code or other IDE settings (share as .vscode folder)
- [ ] Setup pre-commit hooks for code formatting (black, isort)
- [ ] Configure linting with flake8 or pylint
- [ ] Add type checking with mypy
- [ ] Setup Jupyter notebook configuration (if using notebooks)

## CI/CD Foundation
- [ ] Create basic GitHub Actions workflow:
  - [ ] Code linting checks
  - [ ] Unit test execution 
  - [ ] Documentation build
- [ ] Add testing framework (pytest)
- [ ] Create initial test suite structure
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting

## Documentation Framework
- [ ] Create template for ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- [ ] Setup documentation system (MkDocs or Sphinx)
- [ ] Add docstring convention guidelines
- [ ] Create first API documentation template

## Project Management
- [ ] Setup project board (GitHub Projects)
- [ ] Create initial milestone and sprint structure
- [ ] Add issue templates for bugs, features, and documentation

## Security
- [ ] Add proper environment variable handling for API keys
- [ ] Create credential management system for external services
- [ ] Set up secure storage for model weights and data

## Core Scripts
- [ ] Create main entry point script 
- [ ] Implement configuration loading utility
- [ ] Add logging framework with configurable levels
- [ ] Create simple model loading script as proof of concept

## Containerization
- [ ] Create basic Dockerfile for development
- [ ] Add docker-compose.yml for multi-container setup
- [ ] Include GPU passthrough configuration

This checklist covers all the essential elements for establishing a robust development environment for our MTG AI project. Would you like me to prioritize or expand on any specific sections?
