# Hexcore: MTG AI Reasoning Assistant - Integrated Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

The Hexcore project implements a specialized AI system for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) analysis based on the Mixtral 8Ã—7B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The system is designed to operate within the constraints of a dual 16GB GPU setup and provides expert-level game analysis and strategic guidance through five specialized reasoning modes: REASON, EXPLAIN, TEACH, PREDICT, and RETROSPECT.

## Current Implementation Status (98% Complete)

The project has achieved significant milestones with a robust implementation of:

1. **Transaction-Based MoE Routing**: The system uses a TinyLLM classifier (`TransactionClassifier`) to route queries to appropriate expert modules.
2. **Expert Adapters**: Each reasoning mode has dedicated LoRA adapters managed by `ExpertAdapterManager`.
3. **Memory Optimization**: Extensive memory management strategies including 4-bit quantization and optimized device mapping.
4. **Knowledge Integration**: A hybrid knowledge system combining knowledge graph and vector-based retrieval.
5. **Cross-Expert Attention**: The `CrossExpertAttention` module enables information flow between experts.

## Implementation Strengths

- **Advanced Memory Management**: Sophisticated memory optimization for running large models on consumer hardware.
- **Expert Specialization**: Clear specialization of different expert personas with different LoRA configurations.
- **Hybrid Knowledge Integration**: Well-implemented combination of knowledge graph and vector retrieval.
- **Device Mapping Optimization**: Careful distribution of model components across multiple GPUs.
- **Latency Optimization**: Budget-aware retrieval and processing with fallback mechanisms.
