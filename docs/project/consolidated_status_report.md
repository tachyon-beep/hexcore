**Author**: Cline AI Assistant  
**Project**: Hexcore - MTG AI Reasoning Assistant

## Executive Summary

The Hexcore MTG AI Reasoning Assistant project has successfully implemented core architectural components for a sophisticated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system based on the Mixtral 8×7B model. The system is designed to provide expert-level analysis, explanation, and instruction for Magic: The Gathering players through five specialized expert types (REASON, EXPLAIN, TEACH, PREDICT, and RETROSPECT).

Recently completed memory optimization features have resolved critical issues with dual 16GB GPU utilization, significantly improving memory balance and stability. All integration tests are now passing, including previously problematic KV cache tests, signaling a major milestone in system stability. The architecture is fundamentally sound, with most core components fully implemented and tested.

The knowledge integration system has seen significant advancement with the implementation of an advanced hybrid retrieval system combining vector search and knowledge graph traversal. This system intelligently selects and formats knowledge for model consumption while maintaining strict latency budgets.

Current development priorities include finalizing training infrastructure for expert-specific adapters and implementing advanced features for production-readiness. The project is approximately 85% complete, with the fundamental capabilities operational and remaining work primarily focused on optimization and enhanced functionality.
