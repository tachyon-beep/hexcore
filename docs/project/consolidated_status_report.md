**Project**: Hexcore - MTG AI Reasoning Assistant

## Executive Summary

The Hexcore MTG AI Reasoning Assistant project has successfully implemented core architectural components for a sophisticated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system based on the Mixtral 8×7B model. The system is designed to provide expert-level analysis, explanation, and instruction for Magic: The Gathering players through five specialized expert types (REASON, EXPLAIN, TEACH, PREDICT, and RETROSPECT).

Recently completed memory optimization features have resolved critical issues with dual 16GB GPU utilization, significantly improving memory balance and stability. All integration tests are now passing, including previously problematic KV cache tests, signaling a major milestone in system stability. The architecture is fundamentally sound, with most core components fully implemented and tested.
