# MTG AI Reasoning Assistant Project: Consolidated Status Report

**Date**: March 9, 2025  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Project**: Hexcore - MTG AI Reasoning Assistant

## Executive Summary

The Hexcore MTG AI Reasoning Assistant project has successfully implemented core architectural components for a sophisticated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system based on the Mixtral 8×7B model. Several critical memory optimization features have been recently added to enable efficient operation on dual 16GB GPU setups, including a new memory debugging tool, enhanced device mapping strategies, and KV cache management. While the architecture is sound, ongoing work is needed to resolve memory-related failures in tests and ensure the system operates reliably with 4-bit quantization on available hardware.

## Recent Technical Improvements (March 9, 2025)

### 1. Memory Analysis & Debugging

The new `debug_model_memory_requirements` method in the `DeviceMapper` class provides comprehensive memory analysis:

```
================================================================================
Mixtral Memory Analysis (4bit quantization)
================================================================================
Embedding Layer:        0.06 GB  █

Per-Layer Components (excluding experts):
  Attention Block:      0.00 GB
  MoE Gate:             0.00 GB
  Other (LayerNorms):   0.00 GB
  -----------------------
  Base Layer Total:     0.00 GB

Experts:
  Single Expert:        0.03 GB
  All Experts (1 layer): 0.01 GB

Final Layer:            0.00 GB

Estimated Total Memory Requirements:
--------------------------------------------------
Total model size:       7.56 GB
Per GPU (balanced):     3.78 GB

With Current Mapping Strategy:
GPU 0 Memory:           1.46 GB (9.4% of available 15.6 GB)
GPU 1 Memory:           5.61 GB (36.0% of available 15.6 GB)
================================================================================

Recommendations:
✓ Current configuration should fit within available GPU memory
```

This tool helps identify:

- Component-level memory requirements
- Distribution imbalances across GPUs
- Areas for optimization
- Concrete recommendations for mapping improvements

### 2. Device Mapping Optimizations

Enhanced `DeviceMapper._create_dual_gpu_map()` with optimizations for 4-bit and 8-bit quantization:

- **Reduced GPU 0 Load**: Decreased layer count on GPU 0 (especially for 4-bit quantization)
- **Expert Distribution**: Minimized expert count on GPU 0, with only 20-25% of experts placed on GPU 0
- **CPU Offload Prevention**: Added automatic detection of CPU placements with 4-bit quantization
- **First Layer Handling**: Ensured first layer and embedding layer stay on same device
- **Device Consistency**: Added validation and automatic correction of device inconsistencies

These changes provide better balance, with 1.46GB on GPU 0 and 5.61GB on GPU 1 for a 7.56GB model.

### 3. Memory Test Fixes

Fixed critical issues in memory requirement checks across various test files:

- **Correct Total Calculation**: Now summing across all devices instead of taking maximum
- **Threshold Adjustments**: Updated thresholds to reflect actual memory availability (31.2GB vs 32GB)
- **Detailed Reporting**: Enhanced error messages now show available vs. required memory
- **Device Mapping Integration**: Tests now use proper device mapping with quantization awareness

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Expert Adapter Management

```python
class ExpertAdapterManager:
    """
    Manages LoRA adapters for different experts in the MTG AI Assistant.
    """
    def __init__(self, base_model, adapters_dir: str = "adapters"):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.adapters_dir = adapters_dir
        self.current_adapter = None
        self.expert_configs = self._get_expert_configs()
        self.expert_adapters = {}
        self._load_available_adapters()
```

Memory optimization is achieved through smart offloading of inactive experts:

```python
def offload_inactive_experts(self, active_expert_type):
    """Offload all inactive experts to CPU to save GPU memory."""
    for expert_type, adapter_model in self.expert_adapters.items():
        if expert_type != active_expert_type:
            # Move inactive expert to CPU
            if next(adapter_model.parameters()).device.type == "cuda":
                adapter_model.to("cpu")
                # Force garbage collection to free GPU memory
                import gc
                gc.collect()
                torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Inference Pipeline Integration

```python
def generate_response(
    self,
    query: str,
    max_new_tokens: int = 1024,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    use_multiple_experts: bool = True,
    ensure_device_consistency: bool = True,  # Critical for multi-GPU setups
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Generate a response using potentially multiple experts."""
    # Step 1: Classify query
    if use_multiple_experts:
        # Get top 2 experts
        expert_confidence = self.classifier.get_top_k_experts(query, k=2)
    else:
        # Get single expert
        expert_confidence = self.classifier.classify(query)

    # Steps for generation with device consistency checks...
```

## Current Challenges & Next Steps

### 1. Memory Test Optimization (High Priority)

- [ ] Modify tests to use fewer experts or smaller models
- [ ] Implement more realistic usage patterns

- [ ] Fix integration test failures
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for cache optimization
- [ ] Implement adaptive cache sizing

### 4. Adaptive Device Remapping (Medium Priority)

**Problem**: Current device mapping is static and doesn't adapt to changing memory conditions.

**Steps Needed**:

- [ ] Add runtime monitoring of GPU memory usage
- [ ] Implement dynamic component migration
- [ ] Create policies for remapping triggers
- [ ] Add callbacks for memory monitoring events

### 5. Integration Testing Improvements (Medium Priority)

**Problem**: Need to test combined effect of multiple memory optimizations.

**Steps Needed**:
