# Training & Deployment Roadmap: MTG AI Reasoning Assistant

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for creating, training, and deploying the MTG AI Reasoning Assistant based on the Mixtral 8×7B model. The document outlines the complete journey from dataset preparation through model training to deployment, with clear milestones and risk mitigation strategies. It is designed to guide data scientists, ML engineers, and project managers through the process of building a specialized AI assistant that can analyze plays, assemble decks, answer rules questions, and provide expert reasoning about Magic: The Gathering through multiple reasoning modes.

## 1. Dataset Design & Preparation

Creating high-quality, diverse datasets is crucial for training an effective MTG assistant. We divide our data collection into four primary categories, each supporting different capabilities of the final system.

### 1.1 Game State → Optimal Play Data

This dataset focuses on teaching the model to analyze board states and recommend strategic plays.

**Data Sources:**

- **Expert-Annotated Scenarios**: We will collect and create textual descriptions of board states paired with expert-recommended moves and reasoning. For example:

  ```text
  [Game State]
  Turn 5
  Your life: 15, Opponent's life: 12
  Your board: Island (tapped), Plains (tapped), Mountain (untapped), Goblin Guide (2/2)
  Opponent's board: Forest (untapped), Swamp (untapped), Llanowar Elves (1/1), Tarmogoyf (3/4)
  Your hand: Lightning Bolt, Path to Exile, Mana Leak
  Cards in graveyard: Land (1), Instant (1), Sorcery (1)

  [Expert Reasoning]
  Tarmogoyf is currently a 3/4 because there are three card types in graveyards. The main threat is Tarmogoyf as it can attack for 3 damage next turn. I have two removal options: Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile. Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage, which isn't enough to kill Tarmogoyf. Path to Exile can remove it but gives the opponent a land. Mana Leak is ineffective against already-played permanents.

  [Optimal Play]
  Cast Path to Exile targeting Tarmogoyf. While this gives the opponent an additional land, removing their main threat is priority. Hold Lightning Bolt for smaller creatures or direct damage to close the game.
  ```

- **Game Logs Analysis**: We will acquire gameplay logs from MTG Arena or Magic Online, focusing on games played by high-ranked players or in tournament settings. These logs will be parsed to extract key decision points, annotated with explanations of why certain plays were optimal. For multi-turn sequences that demonstrate strategic thinking, we'll include the full sequence with commentary.

- **Synthetic Generation**: We will develop a system to generate diverse game scenarios, with the following approach:
  1. Create a parameterized game state generator that can produce millions of valid board states by varying life totals, mana availability, cards in hand, and battlefield presence
  2. Use GPT-4 or a specialized rules engine to determine optimal plays for these scenarios
  3. Generate expert-like reasoning for each scenario using chain-of-thought prompting
  4. Validate a subset of these scenarios with actual MTG experts to ensure quality

**Volume and Distribution:**

- 10,000+ diverse game states
- Distribution across different formats (Standard, Modern, Commander, Limited)
- Balance between early-game, mid-game, and late-game scenarios
- Coverage of common archetypes and matchups
- Special emphasis on complex decision points where multiple reasonable options exist

### 1.2 Deckbuilding & Meta Knowledge Data

This dataset will train the model to suggest and explain deck construction decisions based on archetypes, metagame analysis, and player preferences.

**Data Sources:**

- **Tournament Decklists**: We will collect top-performing decklists from MTGGoldfish, MTGTop8, and official tournament results. Each decklist will be annotated with:

  - Format legality (Standard, Modern, Commander, etc.)
  - Archetype classification (Aggro, Control, Combo, Midrange, etc.)
  - Key synergies and win conditions
  - Budget category (budget, mid-range, premium)

- **Deck Guides**: We will gather detailed deck tech articles and guides from strategy sites, properly formatted to highlight:

  - Card choices and their justifications
  - Sideboard strategies for different matchups
  - Mulligan guidance
  - Play patterns and tips

- **Metagame Analysis**: We will compile periodic meta reports and analysis, including:
  - Tier lists of competitive decks
  - Matchup win percentages
  - Format trends and evolution
  - Impact of new set releases on the meta

**Example Format:**

```text
[Archetype Description]
Mono-Red Burn (Modern)
Aggro strategy that uses efficient direct damage spells and creatures to quickly reduce opponent's life total. Aims to win by turn 4-5 before opponent stabilizes.

[Decklist]
4 Lightning Bolt
4 Lava Spike
4 Goblin Guide
...

[Card Choice Rationale]
Lightning Bolt: Format staple that provides 3 damage for 1 mana with instant speed flexibility.
Goblin Guide: Efficient 2/2 with haste for early damage, with a downside that is often irrelevant in a fast game.
...

[Metagame Position]
Tier 2 deck in current Modern meta (June 2024)
Favorable matchups: Control (65%), Combo (60%)
Unfavorable matchups: Soul Sisters (40%), Martyr Proc (35%)
...

[Budget Considerations]
Total cost: ~$400 (Paper), ~200 tix (MTGO)
Budget substitutions: Skewer the Critics instead of Eidolon of the Great Revel cuts cost by $100
```

**Volume and Distribution:**

- 5,000+ decklists across all major formats
- 500+ detailed deck guides with explanations
- 50+ meta analysis reports covering different time periods
- Coverage of both competitive and casual/EDH formats

### 1.3 Rules Q&A and Card Knowledge

This dataset will train the model to provide accurate rules information and card interactions, functioning like a knowledgeable judge.

**Data Sources:**

- **MTG Comprehensive Rules**: We will convert the official comprehensive rules document into a structured format suitable for training, with:

  - Rule sections clearly delineated
  - Cross-references preserved
  - Keywords and game terms highlighted

- **Card Oracle Texts**: We will compile the official Oracle text for all 25,000+ MTG cards, including:

  - Current text, accounting for errata
  - Mana cost and converted mana cost
  - Card types, subtypes, and supertypes
  - Power/toughness/loyalty as applicable
  - Set information and legality in various formats

- **Gatherer Rulings**: We will collect official rulings from Gatherer for cards with complex interactions or frequent rules questions.

- **Judge Q&A Pairs**: We will create a dataset of common rules questions and their official answers, sourced from:
  - Judge forums
  - Rules Q&A columns
  - StackExchange and Reddit threads
  - Official FAQs

**Example Format:**

```text
[Question]
If I control Rest in Peace and my opponent plays Bloodghast, will Bloodghast's ability trigger when they play a land?

[Rules Reference]
Rest in Peace: "If a card or token would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead."
Bloodghast: "Bloodghast has haste as long as an opponent has 10 or less life. Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may return Bloodghast from your graveyard to the battlefield."
Rule 614.6: "If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities."

[Answer]
No, Bloodghast's ability will not trigger. Rest in Peace creates a replacement effect that exiles cards that would go to the graveyard instead. Since Bloodghast never reaches the graveyard (it's exiled instead), its Landfall ability cannot trigger when a land enters the battlefield. The ability specifically checks for Bloodghast in the graveyard, but with Rest in Peace, it's in exile instead.
```

**Volume and Distribution:**

- Complete comprehensive rules document (250+ pages)
- Oracle text for all 25,000+ unique cards
- 10,000+ rules Q&A pairs
- Focus on complex interactions, edge cases, and frequently asked questions

### 1.4 Reasoning & Tutorial Data

This dataset focuses on developing the model's ability to explain concepts and teach players, emphasizing clear communication and educational value.

**Data Sources:**

- **Tutorial Dialogues**: We will create multi-turn conversations showing how to explain MTG concepts at different expertise levels:

  ```text
  [Tutorial: Understanding the Stack]
  User: I'm new to Magic. What exactly is "the stack" and how does it work?

  Assistant (TEACH): The stack in Magic is like a pile of spells and abilities waiting to resolve. Imagine you and your opponent taking turns putting cards on a pile - the last card placed is the first one to resolve.

  Let's use an example:
  1. You cast Lightning Bolt targeting your opponent
  2. Your opponent responds by casting Counterspell targeting your Lightning Bolt
  3. You respond by casting your own Counterspell targeting their Counterspell

  Now we have a stack with 3 spells:
  Top: Your Counterspell
  Middle: Opponent's Counterspell
  Bottom: Your Lightning Bolt

  We resolve from top to bottom:
  1. Your Counterspell resolves, countering their Counterspell
  2. Their Counterspell is countered and does nothing
  3. Your Lightning Bolt resolves, dealing 3 damage

  Would you like me to explain this in more detail or give another example?
  ```

- **Concept Explainers**: We will develop explanations of core MTG concepts with:

  - Multiple difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - Visual analogies and metaphors
  - Step-by-step breakdowns
  - Common misconceptions addressed

- **Strategic Guides**: We will compile educational content on strategy development:
  - Card evaluation principles
  - Tempo vs. card advantage explanations
  - Turn sequencing guidelines
  - Meta analysis methods

**Volume and Distribution:**

- 5,000+ tutorial dialogues covering rules, strategy, and card interactions
- 500+ concept explainers at various complexity levels
- Content balanced between:
  - TEACH mode (educational, scaffolded learning)
  - EXPLAIN mode (clear, concise explanations)
  - RETROSPECT mode (analysis of past games/decisions)

### 1.5 Data Processing & Quality Control

All datasets will undergo rigorous processing and quality control:

1. **Standardization**: Consistent formatting across all examples, with clear delineation of inputs and outputs

2. **Verification**: Rules information verified against official sources; strategic advice validated by experts

3. **Deduplication**: Removal of redundant examples while preserving important variations

4. **Balanced Representation**: Ensure coverage across different:

   - Card types and mechanics
   - Formats and archetypes
   - Complexity levels
   - Reasoning modes

5. **Validation Split**: Create separate validation sets for each data category to measure model performance

We will establish a data versioning system to track dataset evolution and enable reproducible training runs. Continuous data collection pipelines will be established to incorporate new cards, rules updates, and metagame shifts over time.

## 2. Reasoning Methodologies

The MTG assistant will implement multiple reasoning methodologies to handle complex game logic, strategic planning, and educational instruction. Each methodology addresses different aspects of MTG reasoning.

### 2.1 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Implementation

Chain-of-Thought reasoning enables the model to break down complex problems into intermediate steps, making it ideal for analyzing game states and rules interactions.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. **Explicit Reasoning Steps**: We will incorporate structured CoT patterns in our training data, using formats like:

   ```text
   [Begin Reasoning]
   Step 1: Analyze board state...
   Step 2: Evaluate available options...
   Step 3: Consider opponent's possible responses...
   Step 4: Calculate probability of success...
   [End Reasoning]

   Therefore, the optimal play is...
   ```

2. **Stepwise Prompting**: During inference, we will use system-level prompts that encourage step-by-step reasoning:

   ```text
   Think through this MTG problem carefully, step-by-step:
   1. First, analyze the current game state and resources
   2. Next, identify all possible legal plays
   3. For each possible play, evaluate its immediate impact
   4. Consider opponent's likely responses
   5. Determine the play with highest expected value
   ```

3. **Self-Verification Loop**: The REASON expert will implement a verification mechanism:

   ```python
   def reason_with_verification(query, game_state):
       # First pass: generate reasoning steps
       initial_reasoning = generate_reasoning(query, game_state)

       # Verification: check for rule violations or logical errors
       verification_prompt = f"Verify the following reasoning for errors:\n{initial_reasoning}"
       verification = generate_verification(verification_prompt)

       # If errors detected, regenerate with corrections
       if "error" in verification.lower():
           corrected_reasoning = generate_reasoning(query, game_state,
                                                 verification)
           return corrected_reasoning
       return initial_reasoning
   ```

4. **Rules Grounding**: CoT reasoning will be explicitly grounded in MTG rules through targeted retrieval:

   ```text
   [Reasoning Step 3]
   According to rule 509.2, I must assign at least lethal damage to the first blocking creature before assigning damage to the second blocker. Since Tarmogoyf has 4 toughness and my attacker has 5 power, I must assign 4 damage to Tarmogoyf and can only assign 1 to the other blocker, which isn't lethal.
   ```

**Benefits for MTG Reasoning:**

- Makes complex rules interactions transparent and traceable
- Enables detection of logical errors in the reasoning process
- Allows the model to show its work, increasing user confidence in recommendations
- Particularly valuable for REASON and PREDICT modes

### 2.2 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Integration

MCTS enables systematic exploration of possible game trajectories by simulating future states. While full MCTS is computationally expensive, we will implement a simplified version suitable for MTG.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. **Simplified State Representation**: We will develop a compact representation of MTG game states that captures essential information while being computationally manageable:

   ```python
   class SimplifiedMTGState:
       def __init__(self):
           self.life_totals = {"player": 20, "opponent": 20}
           self.mana = {"player": {}, "opponent": {}}
           self.board = {"player": [], "opponent": []}
           self.hand = {"player": [], "opponent": []}
           # Additional relevant state information
   ```

2. **Action Generator**: Create a function that generates possible actions from a given state:

   ```python
   def generate_actions(state, active_player):
       """Generate legal actions for the active player."""
       actions = []
       # Add land play if available
       # Add castable spells based on mana
       # Add possible attacks/blocks
       # Add activatable abilities
       return actions
   ```

3. **Limited-Depth Simulation**: Rather than full game simulation, we'll implement a limited-depth look-ahead:

   ```python
   def evaluate_action_sequence(state, actions, depth=3):
       """Evaluate a sequence of actions to a limited depth."""
       current_state = state.copy()
       for i, action in enumerate(actions):
           if i >= depth:
               break
           current_state = apply_action(current_state, action)
           # Check for game-ending conditions
           if is_game_over(current_state):
               break

       return evaluate_position(current_state)
   ```

4. **Integration with LLM Reasoning**: The model will use its reasoning capabilities to evaluate positions and guide the search:

   ```python
   def llm_evaluate_position(state_description):
       """Use LLM to evaluate a position's favorability."""
       prompt = f"Evaluate this MTG position on a scale of 0-100, where 100 means the player will certainly win:\n{state_description}"
       response = model.generate(prompt)
       # Extract numerical evaluation
       return parse_evaluation(response)
   ```

5. **Action Selection**: After simulating multiple paths, select the action with best expected outcome:

   ```python
   def select_best_action(state, possible_actions, num_simulations=10):
       action_values = {}

       for action in possible_actions:
           total_value = 0
           for _ in range(num_simulations):
               # Sample a trajectory starting with this action
               value = simulate_trajectory(state, action)
               total_value += value

           action_values[action] = total_value / num_simulations

       return max(action_values.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
   ```

**Benefits for MTG Reasoning:**

- Enables forward-looking play analysis (especially for PREDICT mode)
- Helps identify non-obvious lines of play
- Can evaluate complex board states with many interaction possibilities
- Provides quantitative assessments of different lines of play

### 2.3 DeepSeek R1-Style Reasoning

DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional reasoning through structured output formats and extensive internal deliberation. We will adapt key elements of this approach to our MTG assistant.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. **Structured Reasoning Format**: We will train the model on examples that follow a specific format separating reasoning and answers:

   ```text
   <begin_of_thought>
   [Detailed internal reasoning process exploring all aspects of the problem]
   [Multiple approaches considered]
   [Evidence evaluation]
   [Step-by-step deduction]
   <end_of_thought>

   <begin_of_solution>
   [Clear, concise answer based on the reasoning]
   <end_of_solution>
   ```

2. **Reasoning Length Optimization**: R1 benefits from extended reasoning. We will train our model to produce detailed reasoning:

   ```python
   def generate_with_extended_reasoning(prompt, min_reasoning_tokens=500):
       """Generate a response with extended reasoning."""
       response = model.generate(
           prompt,
           max_tokens=4096,  # Allow plenty of space for reasoning
           stop_sequences=["<end_of_thought>"],
           temperature=0.3   # Lower temperature for logical consistency
       )

       # If reasoning is too short, prompt for more detail
       if token_count(response) < min_reasoning_tokens:
           response += model.generate(
               response + "\nConsider additional factors and implications...",
               max_tokens=1000,
               stop_sequences=["<end_of_thought>"]
           )

       # Generate the solution after reasoning
       solution = model.generate(
           response + "<end_of_thought>\n\n<begin_of_solution>",
           max_tokens=500,
           stop_sequences=["<end_of_solution>"]
       )

       return response + "<end_of_thought>\n\n<begin_of_solution>" + solution + "<end_of_solution>"
   ```

3. **Self-Refinement Loop**: We will implement an iterative refinement process:

   ```python
   def iterative_refinement(query, game_state, iterations=3):
       """Generate a response with iterative self-refinement."""
       current_answer = generate_initial_answer(query, game_state)

       for i in range(iterations):
           critique_prompt = f"Critique the following answer and identify any errors or omissions:\n{current_answer}"
           critique = generate_critique(critique_prompt)

           if "no issues found" in critique.lower():
               break

           refinement_prompt = f"Original query: {query}\nGame state: {game_state}\nPrevious answer: {current_answer}\nCritique: {critique}\n\nProvide an improved answer addressing the critique."
           current_answer = generate_refined_answer(refinement_prompt)

       return current_answer
   ```

4. **Knowledge Integration**: R1-style reasoning will be augmented with retrieved knowledge:

   ```text
   <begin_of_thought>
   First, I need to check the rules for how protection works.

   [Retrieved Rule]: "702.16. Protection. 702.16a Protection is a static ability, written 'Protection from [quality].' 702.16b A permanent or player with protection can't be targeted by spells with the stated quality, can't be targeted by abilities from a source with the stated quality, can't be blocked by creatures with the stated quality, and prevents all damage that would be dealt to it by sources with the stated quality."

   Based on this rule, let me analyze whether Lightning Bolt can target a creature with protection from red...
   <end_of_thought>
   ```

**Benefits for MTG Reasoning:**

- Produces rigorous, comprehensive reasoning
- Enables self-checking and refinement
- Particularly valuable for complex rules interactions
- Supports both REASON and EXPLAIN modes effectively

### 2.4 Comparing Reasoning Approaches

Each reasoning methodology has strengths for different MTG tasks. We will integrate them intelligently based on the nature of the query:

| Reasoning Approach | Strengths                                                                    | Best For                                                                        | Integration                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Chain-of-Thought   | Clear step-by-step logic, Transparent reasoning, Easy to follow              | Rules interactions, Analyzing board states, Explaining card interactions        | REASON and EXPLAIN experts          |
| MCTS Integration   | Forward-looking analysis, Quantitative evaluation, Explores multiple futures | Line of play optimization, Complex combat decisions, Win probability assessment | PREDICT expert                      |
| R1-Style Reasoning | Comprehensive analysis, Self-checking, Structured output                     | Complex rules questions, Edge case handling, Teaching difficult concepts        | All experts, most heavily in REASON |

**Implementation Strategy:**

During training and inference, we will implement a hybrid approach that leverages multiple reasoning methodologies based on query type:

```python
def determine_reasoning_approach(query, transaction_type):
    """Determine the best reasoning approach based on query and transaction type."""
    if "probability" in query.lower() or "best play" in query.lower():
        # Forward-looking analysis benefits from MCTS
        return "mcts_guided"

    if transaction_type == "REASON" and "interact" in query.lower():
        # Complex rules interactions benefit from R1-style reasoning
        return "r1_style"

    if transaction_type == "TEACH":
        # Teaching benefits from clear CoT with examples
        return "cot_with_examples"

    # Default to standard chain-of-thought
    return "standard_cot"
```

We will measure the effectiveness of each approach on our validation set to develop heuristics for optimal reasoning methodology selection.

## 3. Training Implementation

Building on our dataset design and reasoning methodologies, we will implement a comprehensive training pipeline to create the MTG AI Assistant.

### 3.1 Data Formatting & Processing Pipeline

Our data processing pipeline will transform raw MTG content into structured training examples optimized for fine-tuning.

**Pipeline Components:**

1. **Data Collection System**: Automated scrapers and API integrations to gather content from multiple sources:

   ```python
   class MTGDataCollector:
       def collect_decklists(self, source="mtggoldfish", format="modern", count=100):
           """Collect recent decklists from specified source."""
           if source == "mtggoldfish":
               return self._scrape_mtggoldfish_decklists(format, count)
           elif source == "mtgtop8":
               return self._scrape_mtgtop8_decklists(format, count)
           # Additional sources...

       def collect_card_data(self, source="scryfall"):
           """Collect comprehensive card data."""
           if source == "scryfall":
               return self._scrape_scryfall_cards()
           # Additional sources...

       # Implementation of scraping methods...
   ```

2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Clean and normalize collected data:

   ```python
   class MTGDataPreprocessor:
       def preprocess_decklist(self, raw_decklist):
           """Clean and structure a raw decklist."""
           # Extract main deck and sideboard
           # Normalize card names
           # Calculate mana curve and color distribution
           # Tag with archetype if possible
           return structured_decklist

       def preprocess_rule_text(self, raw_rule):
           """Clean and structure rule text."""
           # Extract rule number and text
           # Fix formatting issues
           # Handle cross-references
           return structured_rule

       # Additional preprocessing methods...
   ```

3. **Format Conversion**: Transform processed data into training examples:

   ```python
   class MTGExampleFormatter:
       def format_decklist_example(self, structured_decklist, archetype):
           """Format a decklist into a training example."""
           instruction = f"Analyze this {archetype} deck in {structured_decklist['format']} format."
           input_text = self._format_decklist_as_text(structured_decklist)

           # Generate appropriate output using templates or expert annotations
           output_text = self._generate_deck_analysis(structured_decklist, archetype)

           return {
               "instruction": instruction,
               "input": input_text,
               "output": output_text,
               "expert_type": "REASON"  # or appropriate expert type
           }

       # Additional formatting methods...
   ```

4. **Validation System**: Verify example quality:

   ```python
   class MTGExampleValidator:
       def validate_rule_example(self, example):
           """Validate a rule-based example for accuracy."""
           # Check if referenced rules exist
           # Verify logical consistency
           # Ensure proper formatting
           return is_valid, issues

       # Additional validation methods...
   ```

5. **Batch Preparation**: Create training batches with balanced content:

   ```python
   class MTGTrainingBatchCreator:
       def create_balanced_batch(self, examples, batch_size=1000):
           """Create a balanced batch of training examples."""
           # Ensure representation of all expert types
           # Balance different MTG formats
           # Mix complexity levels
           return balanced_batch

       # Additional batch creation methods...
   ```

**Example Processing Flow:**

```text
Raw Data → Collection → Preprocessing → Formatting → Validation → Batch Creation → Training
```

For each data source, we will create specialized preprocessing logic to handle format-specific requirements, ensuring consistent output structure regardless of input source.

### 3.2 Synthetic Data Generation

To supplement our collected data and ensure comprehensive coverage, we'll implement synthetic data generation techniques.

**Generation Approaches:**

1. **Game State Generator**: Create diverse game scenarios through parameterized generation:

   ```python
   class GameStateGenerator:
       def generate_diverse_game_states(self, count=1000, complexity_range=(1, 5)):
           """Generate diverse game states with specified complexity."""
           game_states = []

           for _ in range(count):
               # Randomly select complexity level
               complexity = random.randint(complexity_range[0], complexity_range[1])

               # Generate state based on complexity
               if complexity == 1:
                   # Simple state with few permanents
                   game_state = self._generate_simple_state()
               elif complexity == 2:
                   # Moderate complexity with more permanents and some abilities
                   game_state = self._generate_moderate_state()
               # Additional complexity levels...

               game_states.append(game_state)

           return game_states

       # Implementation of state generation methods...
   ```

2. **LLM-Based Expansion**: Use GPT-4 or a specialized model to expand seed examples:

   ```python
   class LLMDataExpander:
       def __init__(self, llm_api):
           self.llm_api = llm_api

       def expand_rule_question(self, seed_question):
           """Generate variations of a rule question."""
           prompt = f"""
           Create 5 variations of this MTG rules question, involving the same cards
           but asking about different aspects or edge cases:

           Original question: {seed_question}
           """

           response = self.llm_api.generate(prompt)

           # Parse response to extract variations
           return self._parse_variations(response)

       # Additional expansion methods...
   ```

3. **Template-Based Generation**: Use templates to create examples with consistent structure:

   ```python
   class TemplateBasedGenerator:
       def generate_combat_questions(self, card_database, count=100):
           """Generate questions about combat interactions."""
           templates = [
               "If I attack with {attacker} and my opponent blocks with {blocker}, what happens?",
               "Does {attacker}'s ability trigger when blocked by {blocker}?",
               "How much damage would {attacker} deal to {blocker} in combat?",
               # Additional templates...
           ]

           questions = []

           for _ in range(count):
               template = random.choice(templates)

               # Select appropriate cards for the template
               attacker = self._select_random_attacker(card_database)
               blocker = self._select_random_blocker(card_database)

               # Fill in template
               question = template.format(attacker=attacker["name"], blocker=blocker["name"])

               # Generate appropriate answer
               answer = self._generate_combat_answer(attacker, blocker)

               questions.append({"question": question, "answer": answer})

           return questions

       # Additional generation methods...
   ```

4. **Adversarial Example Generation**: Create challenging examples to improve model robustness:

   ```python
   class AdversarialExampleGenerator:
       def generate_edge_case_rules(self, card_database, rule_database):
           """Generate edge cases involving complex rule interactions."""
           # Find cards with replacement effects
           replacement_cards = self._find_cards_with_effect(card_database, "replacement")

           # Find cards with triggered abilities
           trigger_cards = self._find_cards_with_effect(card_database, "triggered")

           # Generate interactions that test order of operations
           edge_cases = self._generate_replacement_trigger_interactions(replacement_cards, trigger_cards)

           return edge_cases

       # Additional adversarial generation methods...
   ```

**Quality Control for Synthetic Data:**

We will implement a multi-step verification process for synthetic data:

1. **Rules Compliance Check**: Verify that generated scenarios follow MTG rules
2. **Expert Review Sample**: Have MTG experts review a subset of examples
3. **Consistency Testing**: Ensure answers are consistent with similar scenarios
4. **Difficulty Calibration**: Tag examples with difficulty levels for curriculum learning

### 3.3 Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning Strategy

We will implement a multi-stage fine-tuning approach to effectively train our model while managing hardware constraints.

#### **Stage 1: QLoRA-Based Domain Adaptation**

First, we'll adapt the base Mixtral 8×7B model to the MTG domain using QLoRA:

```python
def prepare_for_qlora(model):
    """Prepare model for QLoRA fine-tuning."""
    from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training

    # Prepare model for 4-bit quantization with LoRA
    model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)

    # Configure LoRA
    lora_config = LoraConfig(
        r=16,                     # Rank of LoRA matrices
        lora_alpha=32,            # LoRA scaling factor
        target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"],  # Attention modules
        lora_dropout=0.05,        # Dropout for LoRA layers
        bias="none",              # Don't add bias parameters
        task_type="CAUSAL_LM"     # Language modeling task
    )

    # Apply LoRA to model
    model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

    return model
```

We'll train on a general MTG dataset to build foundational knowledge:

## 3. Training Implementation (continued)

**Stage 1: QLoRA-Based Domain Adaptation** (continued)

```python
def train_domain_adaptation(model, tokenizer, dataset, output_dir, epochs=3):
    """Train model for MTG domain adaptation."""
    from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

    # Configure training
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir=output_dir,
        per_device_train_batch_size=1,      # Small batch due to memory constraints
        gradient_accumulation_steps=16,     # Accumulate gradients for effective batch size
        learning_rate=2e-4,
        num_train_epochs=epochs,
        logging_steps=100,
        save_steps=1000,
        save_total_limit=3,                 # Keep only the 3 best checkpoints
        fp16=True,                          # Use mixed precision for efficiency
        optim="paged_adamw_8bit",           # Memory-efficient optimizer
        lr_scheduler_type="cosine",         # Cosine learning rate schedule
        warmup_ratio=0.1,                   # Warm up for 10% of training
        evaluation_strategy="steps",
        eval_steps=500,
        load_best_model_at_end=True,
        metric_for_best_model="loss"
    )

    # Set up data collator
    data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        mlm=False                           # Not using masked language modeling
    )

    # Configure trainer
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=dataset["train"],
        eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
        data_collator=data_collator,
        tokenizer=tokenizer
    )

    # Train model
    trainer.train()

    # Save final model
    trainer.save_model(output_dir)

    return model
```

### **Stage 2: Expert-Specific Fine-Tuning**

Next, we'll create separate LoRA adapters for each expert mode:

```python
def train_expert_adapters(base_model, tokenizer, expert_datasets, output_dir):
    """Train separate LoRA adapters for each expert mode."""
    expert_adapters = {}

    # Configure expert-specific training parameters
    expert_params = {
        "REASON": {"r": 16, "dropout": 0.05, "epochs": 4, "lr": 2e-4},
        "EXPLAIN": {"r": 16, "dropout": 0.1, "epochs": 3, "lr": 2.5e-4},
        "TEACH": {"r": 8, "dropout": 0.1, "epochs": 3, "lr": 2.5e-4},
        "PREDICT": {"r": 16, "dropout": 0.05, "epochs": 4, "lr": 2e-4},
        "RETROSPECT": {"r": 8, "dropout": 0.1, "epochs": 3, "lr": 2.5e-4}
    }

    for expert_type, dataset in expert_datasets.items():
        print(f"Training adapter for {expert_type} expert...")

        # Get expert-specific parameters
        params = expert_params[expert_type]

        # Configure LoRA for this expert
        lora_config = LoraConfig(
            r=params["r"],
            lora_alpha=params["r"] * 2,  # alpha typically set to 2x rank
            target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj"],
            lora_dropout=params["dropout"],
            bias="none",
            task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
        )

        # Create fresh model with this LoRA config
        expert_model = get_peft_model(base_model, lora_config)

        # Expert-specific output directory
        expert_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, expert_type.lower())

        # Train adapter
        expert_args = TrainingArguments(
            output_dir=expert_dir,
            per_device_train_batch_size=1,
            gradient_accumulation_steps=16,
            learning_rate=params["lr"],
            num_train_epochs=params["epochs"],
            logging_steps=50,
            save_steps=500,
            fp16=True,
            optim="paged_adamw_8bit",
            lr_scheduler_type="cosine",
            warmup_ratio=0.1
        )

        # Configure trainer with expert-specific data
        trainer = Trainer(
            model=expert_model,
            args=expert_args,
            train_dataset=dataset["train"],
            eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
            data_collator=DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False),
            tokenizer=tokenizer
        )

        # Train expert adapter
        trainer.train()

        # Save adapter
        expert_model.save_pretrained(expert_dir)

        # Store adapter reference
        expert_adapters[expert_type] = expert_dir

    return expert_adapters
```

### **Stage 3: Reasoning Enhancement Fine-Tuning**

In the final stage, we'll enhance the reasoning capabilities through targeted fine-tuning:

```python
def enhance_reasoning_capabilities(model, tokenizer, reasoning_datasets, expert_adapters):
    """Enhance reasoning capabilities through targeted fine-tuning."""
    # Focus on complex reasoning examples
    for expert_type, adapter_path in expert_adapters.items():
        # Load expert model
        expert_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_path)

        # Check if we have reasoning enhancement data for this expert
        if expert_type not in reasoning_datasets:
            print(f"No reasoning enhancement data for {expert_type}, skipping...")
            continue

        print(f"Enhancing reasoning for {expert_type}...")

        # Create custom dataset emphasizing the appropriate reasoning style
        if expert_type == "REASON":
            # Emphasize R1-style structured reasoning
            dataset = reasoning_datasets[expert_type]["r1_style"]
        elif expert_type == "PREDICT":
            # Emphasize Monte Carlo tree search reasoning
            dataset = reasoning_datasets[expert_type]["mcts"]
        else:
            # Default to enhanced CoT reasoning
            dataset = reasoning_datasets[expert_type]["cot"]

        # Configure training with lower learning rate to avoid catastrophic forgetting
        training_args = TrainingArguments(
            output_dir=f"./enhanced_{expert_type.lower()}",
            per_device_train_batch_size=1,
            gradient_accumulation_steps=16,
            learning_rate=5e-5,  # Lower learning rate for fine-tuning
            num_train_epochs=1,  # Fewer epochs to avoid overfitting
            logging_steps=50,
            save_steps=200,
            fp16=True,
            optim="paged_adamw_8bit"
        )

        # Configure trainer
        trainer = Trainer(
            model=expert_model,
            args=training_args,
            train_dataset=dataset["train"],
            eval_dataset=dataset["validation"],
            data_collator=DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False),
            tokenizer=tokenizer
        )

        # Train model
        trainer.train()

        # Save enhanced model
        trainer.save_model(f"./enhanced_{expert_type.lower()}")

    return "Reasoning enhancement complete for all experts"
```

#### **Expert Router Training**

We'll also train a specialized router model to classify queries into expert types:

```python
def train_expert_router(expert_examples, model_name="distilbert-base-uncased"):
    """Train a classifier to route queries to appropriate experts."""
    from datasets import Dataset
    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

    # Create dataset from examples
    texts = [example["query"] for example in expert_examples]
    labels = [example["expert_type"] for example in expert_examples]

    # Map expert types to numeric labels
    expert_types = list(set(labels))
    expert_to_id = {expert: i for i, expert in enumerate(expert_types)}
    numeric_labels = [expert_to_id[expert] for expert in labels]

    # Create dataset
    dataset = Dataset.from_dict({
        "text": texts,
        "label": numeric_labels
    })

    # Split dataset
    dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1)

    # Load tokenizer and model
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        num_labels=len(expert_types)
    )

    # Tokenize dataset
    def tokenize_function(examples):
        return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

    tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

    # Configure training
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir="./router_model",
        per_device_train_batch_size=32,
        learning_rate=5e-5,
        num_train_epochs=3,
        evaluation_strategy="epoch",
        save_strategy="epoch",
        load_best_model_at_end=True,
        metric_for_best_model="accuracy"
    )

    # Train model
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
        eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["test"],
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        compute_metrics=compute_classification_metrics
    )

    trainer.train()

    # Save model
    trainer.save_model("./router_model")

    # Save expert mapping
    with open("./router_model/expert_mapping.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump({
            "id_to_expert": {str(i): expert for expert, i in expert_to_id.items()},
            "expert_to_id": {expert: str(i) for expert, i in expert_to_id.items()}
        }, f)

    return "./router_model"
```

#### **Evaluation During Training**

Throughout training, we'll implement comprehensive evaluation:

```python
def evaluate_model_performance(model, tokenizer, test_datasets):
    """Evaluate model performance on various test sets."""
    results = {}

    # Evaluate on general MTG knowledge
    results["general_knowledge"] = evaluate_knowledge_accuracy(
        model, tokenizer, test_datasets["knowledge"]
    )

    # Evaluate gameplay analysis
    results["gameplay"] = evaluate_gameplay_recommendations(
        model, tokenizer, test_datasets["gameplay"]
    )

    # Evaluate rules accuracy
    results["rules"] = evaluate_rules_accuracy(
        model, tokenizer, test_datasets["rules"]
    )

    # Evaluate deckbuilding recommendations
    results["deckbuilding"] = evaluate_deckbuilding(
        model, tokenizer, test_datasets["deckbuilding"]
    )

    # Evaluate educational quality
    results["education"] = evaluate_educational_quality(
        model, tokenizer, test_datasets["education"]
    )

    # Calculate overall score
    overall_score = sum(results.values()) / len(results)
    results["overall"] = overall_score

    return results
```

### 3.4 Curriculum Learning Approach

We'll implement a curriculum learning strategy that gradually increases complexity:

```python
def create_curriculum_dataset(dataset, difficulty_field="difficulty"):
    """Create a curriculum dataset that progresses from simple to complex examples."""
    # Sort dataset by difficulty
    sorted_dataset = sorted(dataset, key=lambda x: x[difficulty_field])

    # Create curriculum stages
    curriculum_stages = {
        "beginner": sorted_dataset[:int(len(sorted_dataset) * 0.3)],
        "intermediate": sorted_dataset[int(len(sorted_dataset) * 0.3):int(len(sorted_dataset) * 0.7)],
        "advanced": sorted_dataset[int(len(sorted_dataset) * 0.7):]
    }

    return curriculum_stages

def implement_curriculum_learning(model, tokenizer, curriculum_stages, epochs_per_stage=2):
    """Implement curriculum learning, progressively increasing difficulty."""
    # Start with beginner examples
    print("Training on beginner examples...")
    train_on_dataset(model, tokenizer, curriculum_stages["beginner"], epochs=epochs_per_stage)

    # Progress to intermediate
    print("Training on intermediate examples...")
    train_on_dataset(model, tokenizer, curriculum_stages["intermediate"], epochs=epochs_per_stage)

    # Finish with advanced
    print("Training on advanced examples...")
    train_on_dataset(model, tokenizer, curriculum_stages["advanced"], epochs=epochs_per_stage)

    # Final round with mixed examples to prevent catastrophic forgetting
    print("Final mixed training...")
    mixed_dataset = (
        curriculum_stages["beginner"][:int(len(curriculum_stages["beginner"]) * 0.2)] +
        curriculum_stages["intermediate"][:int(len(curriculum_stages["intermediate"]) * 0.3)] +
        curriculum_stages["advanced"]
    )
    train_on_dataset(model, tokenizer, mixed_dataset, epochs=1)

    return model
```

Specifically for MTG, we'll create specialized curriculum progressions:

1. **Rules Complexity Progression**:

   - Basic rules (turn structure, casting spells)
   - Intermediate interactions (triggered abilities, replacement effects)
   - Advanced interactions (layers, state-based actions, timing)

2. **Gameplay Analysis Progression**:

   - Simple board states (few creatures, no complex abilities)
   - Moderate complexity (multiple permanents, some abilities)
   - Complex scenarios (many interactions, timing considerations)

3. **Deckbuilding Progression**:
   - Basic archetype identification
   - Refining existing decklists
   - Building optimized decks from scratch

This curriculum-based approach will ensure the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex scenarios, resulting in better generalization and performance.

## 4. Inference Pipeline Optimization

Once trained, we'll optimize the inference pipeline for responsiveness and accuracy.

### 4.1 Streaming Response Generation

We'll implement streaming generation to provide immediate feedback:

```python
class StreamingMTGAssistant:
    """MTG assistant with streaming response generation."""
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer, classifier, knowledge_retriever):
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.classifier = classifier
        self.knowledge_retriever = knowledge_retriever

    def generate_streaming_response(self, query):
        """Generate a streaming response to a query."""
        from transformers import TextIteratorStreamer
        import threading

        # Determine transaction type
        transaction_type = self.classifier.classify(query)

        # Retrieve relevant knowledge
        knowledge = self.knowledge_retriever.retrieve(query)

        # Prepare prompt with transaction type and knowledge
        prompt = f"<{transaction_type}>\n"
        if knowledge:
            prompt += f"[KNOWLEDGE]\n{knowledge}\n[/KNOWLEDGE]\n"
        prompt += f"Query: {query}"

        # Tokenize
        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(self.model.device)

        # Initialize streamer
        streamer = TextIteratorStreamer(
            self.tokenizer, skip_prompt=True, skip_special_tokens=True
        )

        # Start generation in a separate thread
        generation_kwargs = {
            "input_ids": inputs.input_ids,
            "attention_mask": inputs.attention_mask,
            "max_new_tokens": 2048,
            "temperature": 0.7 if transaction_type in ["EXPLAIN", "TEACH"] else 0.3,
            "do_sample": True,
            "streamer": streamer
        }

        thread = threading.Thread(target=self._generate_thread, kwargs=generation_kwargs)
        thread.start()

        # Return streamer for consumption
        return streamer

    def _generate_thread(self, **kwargs):
        """Run generation in a separate thread."""
        with torch.no_grad():
            self.model.generate(**kwargs)
```

In a web application context, we'll implement a web socket for real-time streaming:

```python
async def stream_response(websocket, path):
    """Stream response via websocket."""
    # Receive query
    query = await websocket.recv()

    # Initialize assistant
    assistant = StreamingMTGAssistant(model, tokenizer, classifier, knowledge_retriever)

    # Get streamer
    streamer = assistant.generate_streaming_response(query)

    # Stream chunks as they're generated
    for chunk in streamer:
        await websocket.send(chunk)
```

### 4.2 Caching Mechanisms

We'll implement multiple layers of caching to improve responsiveness:

## 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

Successfully implementing the MTG AI Reasoning Assistant involves managing several technical and domain-specific risks. This section identifies key risks and outlines mitigation strategies.

### 6.1 Technical Challenges

#### **Risk: Memory Constraints During Training**

The dual 16GB GPU setup may face memory pressure during training, especially with the full Mixtral 8×7B model.

_Mitigation Strategy:_

- Implement aggressive 4-bit quantization from the start
- Use gradient checkpointing to reduce memory at the cost of computation time
- Employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) with careful rank selection
- Split experts across GPUs with tensor parallelism
- Consider offloading optimizer states to CPU if needed
- Monitor memory usage throughout training and adjust batch size dynamically

#### **Risk: Complex Integration of Multiple Components**

The system's complexity with multiple expert adapters, knowledge sources, and reasoning methods could lead to integration challenges.

_Mitigation Strategy:_

- Create modular architecture with clear interfaces between components
- Implement comprehensive integration tests for each component combination
- Develop fallback mechanisms when components fail
- Start with simplified versions of each component and gradually increase complexity
- Use feature flags to enable/disable components for debugging
- Maintain detailed logs of component interactions

#### **Risk: Inference Latency Exceeding User Expectations**

Complex reasoning on dual GPUs could result in high latency, degrading user experience.

_Mitigation Strategy:_

- Implement streaming responses to provide immediate feedback
- Create multi-level caching system to avoid redundant computation
- Optimize prompt construction to minimize token count
- Use model quantization during inference
- Precompute and cache common knowledge retrievals
- Implement asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Conduct regular latency profiling to identify bottlenecks

### 6.2 Knowledge Gaps & Mitigation

#### **Risk: Rules Inaccuracies in Complex Interactions**

MTG has thousands of cards with complex rule interactions, and the model might generate incorrect interpretations.

_Mitigation Strategy:_

- Prioritize rules accuracy in training data
- Implement rules verification system using the comprehensive rules
- Create extensive test suite for edge case interactions
- Incorporate retrieval of official rulings for ambiguous cases
- Develop confidence scoring to flag uncertain interpretations
- Implement adversarial testing to find rule interpretation weaknesses
- Create a feedback loop to continuously improve rules knowledge

#### **Risk: Outdated Information as New Sets Release**

MTG constantly evolves with new sets, rule changes, and meta shifts.

_Mitigation Strategy:_

- Design knowledge retrieval system to be easily updated with new information
- Implement automated data collection for new card releases
- Create update pipeline for rules changes
- Develop meta update system for current deck trends
- Use retrieval augmentation to prioritize recent information
- Include version information in responses for transparency
- Schedule regular model updates to incorporate new knowledge

#### **Risk: Inconsistent Response Quality Across Transaction Types**

Different transaction types (REASON, EXPLAIN, etc.) might show uneven quality.

_Mitigation Strategy:_

- Balance training data across all transaction types
- Evaluate each transaction type separately during testing
- Implement specialized enhancement for underperforming transaction types
- Create targeted synthetic data for challenging transaction types
- Develop specific evaluation metrics for each transaction type
- Conduct user testing focused on each transaction type

### 6.3 Fallback Approaches

#### **Risk: QLoRA Fine-Tuning Limitations**

QLoRA may not provide sufficient adaptation for the complex MTG domain.

_Fallback Approach:_

- Prepare alternative fine-tuning approaches (e.g., full fine-tuning of smaller models)
- Create adapter merging strategy to combine multiple smaller adapters
- Develop a simpler model architecture with MTG-specific pre-training
- Investigate distillation from larger to smaller models
- Consider hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques

#### **Risk: Knowledge Retrieval Failures**

The KG/RAG system might fail to retrieve relevant information for complex queries.

_Fallback Approach:_

- Implement tiered retrieval with multiple strategies
- Create fallback search with pattern matching for critical information
- Develop response templates for common query types with embedded knowledge
- Implement query refinement to improve retrieval accuracy
- Design system to transparently acknowledge knowledge limitations

#### **Risk: Expert Routing Misjudgments**

The transaction classifier might misroute queries to inappropriate experts.

_Fallback Approach:_

- Implement confidence thresholds for routing decisions
- Create multi-expert activation for uncertain queries
- Develop query refinement dialogue for ambiguous requests
- Use ensemble classification for important routing decisions
- Implement recovery mechanisms when expert responses are inappropriate

#### **Risk: Reasoning Methodology Ineffectiveness**

Certain reasoning methodologies might prove ineffective for specific MTG scenarios.

_Fallback Approach:_

- Implement adaptive reasoning that can switch methods if needed
- Develop hybrid reasoning approaches combining multiple methodologies
- Create specialized reasoning for different MTG domains (rules vs. strategy)
- Design reasoning verification to detect and correct flawed reasoning
- Implement user guidance to steer reasoning when necessary

## 7. Future Enhancements

While the core MTG AI Reasoning Assistant provides comprehensive capabilities, several future enhancements could extend its functionality and performance.

### 7.1 Model Scaling Strategies

#### **Expert Expansion**

The current system uses five primary expert types. Future versions could implement:

- **Card-Type Experts**: Specialists in creature, instant, sorcery, or enchantment interactions
- **Format Experts**: Dedicated experts for Standard, Modern, Commander, and Limited formats
- **Strategy Experts**: Specialists in aggressive, control, or combo strategies

Implementation approach:

```python
def expand_expert_system(base_model, new_expert_types):
    """Expand the expert system with new specialized experts."""
    # Current expert types
    current_experts = ["REASON", "EXPLAIN", "TEACH", "PREDICT", "RETROSPECT"]

    # Configure and train new expert types
    for expert_type in new_expert_types:
        # Create specialized dataset
        dataset = create_specialized_dataset(expert_type)

        # Configure LoRA for this expert
        lora_config = LoraConfig(
            r=16,
            lora_alpha=32,
            target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"],
            lora_dropout=0.05,
            bias="none",
            task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
        )

        # Train new expert
        expert_model = train_expert(base_model, dataset, lora_config)

        # Save new expert adapter
        expert_model.save_pretrained(f"./experts/{expert_type.lower()}")

    # Update expert router to include new expert types
    update_expert_router(current_experts + new_expert_types)

    return "Expert system expanded successfully"
```

#### **Model Size Scaling**

As hardware capabilities increase, we could scale to larger models:

- **Mixtral 8×22B Migration**: Scale to the larger Mixtral variant with same architecture
- **Expert Parameter Expansion**: Increase LoRA ranks for more expressive adaptation
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combine predictions from multiple specialized models

Implementation approach:

```python
def scale_to_larger_model(current_experts, target_model="mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B"):
    """Scale the current expert system to a larger base model."""
    # Load new base model
    new_base = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        target_model,
        device_map="auto",
        load_in_4bit=True
    )

    # Transfer experts via knowledge distillation
    for expert_type in current_experts:
        # Load current expert
        current_expert = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
            base_model,
            f"./experts/{expert_type.lower()}"
        )

        # Create training data via distillation
        distillation_dataset = create_distillation_dataset(current_expert)

        # Configure new expert
        new_lora_config = LoraConfig(
            r=32,  # Larger rank for more capacity
            lora_alpha=64,
            target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"],
            lora_dropout=0.05,
            bias="none",
            task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
        )

        # Train new expert via distillation
        new_expert = train_expert_with_distillation(
            new_base,
            distillation_dataset,
            new_lora_config
        )

        # Save new expert
        new_expert.save_pretrained(f"./new_experts/{expert_type.lower()}")

    return "Model scaled successfully"
```

        """Process a query that includes an image."""
        # Detect cards in image
        detected_cards = await self.card_detector.detect_cards(image)

        # If board state image, extract state
        if self._is_board_state_image(image):
            board_state = await self._extract_board_state(image)
            return await self._analyze_board_state(query, board_state)

        # If individual card image, identify card
        elif detected_cards and len(detected_cards) == 1:
            card_name = detected_cards[0]
            augmented_query = f"{query} about the card {card_name}"
            return await self.text_model.generate_response(augmented_query)

        # If multiple cards, list them in query
        elif detected_cards and len(detected_cards) > 1:
            card_list = ", ".join(detected_cards)
            augmented_query = f"{query} about these cards: {card_list}"
            return await self.text_model.generate_response(augmented_query)

        # If no cards detected, process image generally
        else:
            image_description = await self.vision_model.describe_image(image)
            augmented_query = f"{query}\nImage description: {image_description}"
            return await self.text_model.generate_response(augmented_query)

        reasoning_depth = "extended"  # Deep reasoning, multiple steps
        max_new_tokens = 2048
        temperature = 0.3
    elif complexity_score > 0.5:
        reasoning_depth = "standard"  # Standard reasoning
        max_new_tokens = 1024

    else:
        reasoning_depth = "basic"     # Basic reasoning

        temperature = 0.7

    # Determine number of experts to activate
    if complexity_score > 0.7:
        num_experts = 2  # Use multiple experts for complex queries
    else:
        num_experts = 1  # Use single expert for simple queries

    # Determine context window size
    context_tokens = min(1024 + int(complexity_score * 3072), 4096)

    return {
        "reasoning_depth": reasoning_depth,
