# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR 002: Knowledge Refresh Strategy for MTG AI Reasoning Assistant

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Magic: The Gathering is a dynamic game with regular updates, including:

- Quarterly set releases (approximately 250+ new cards every 3 months)
- Periodic rules updates and clarifications
- Evolving metagame and strategy developments
- Ban/restricted list changes across formats

The MTG AI Reasoning Assistant relies on accurate and current knowledge about cards, rules, and strategic concepts to provide valuable assistance. Without a systematic approach to knowledge refreshes, the system will gradually become outdated, leading to incorrect or suboptimal advice.

While the current documentation acknowledges the need for knowledge updates, it lacks a comprehensive strategy for how and when these updates should occur, who is responsible for them, and how to maintain system performance during updates.

### Decision

We will implement a comprehensive Knowledge Refresh Strategy with these key components:

1. **Automated Knowledge Acquisition Pipeline**:

   - Develop scheduled scrapers for official Wizards of the Coast resources (Gatherer, card databases, comprehensive rules)
   - Create automated monitoring of rules updates via the official MTG website RSS feeds
   - Implement automated collection of tournament results and metagame data from sources like MTGGoldfish, MTGTop8, and official tournament reports
   - Build verification systems that validate new data against expected schemas and flag anomalies for human review

2. **Knowledge Component Versioning**:

   - Implement semantic versioning for all knowledge components (Card DB, Rules DB, Meta DB)
   - Store version information with timestamps for each knowledge component
   - Track dependencies between knowledge components and model versions
   - Return version information with responses for transparency and debugging

3. **Incremental Update System**:

   - Develop differential update capabilities for knowledge sources
   - Implement targeted retraining for affected components rather than full system retraining
   - Create validation suites for each knowledge component to verify update integrity
   - Build rollback mechanisms for failed updates

4. **Scheduled Update Cadence**:

   - Card Database: Update within 24 hours of official releases
   - Rules Database: Update within 48 hours of comprehensive rules changes
   - Metagame Data: Weekly updates for competitive formats
   - Full system evaluation: Monthly comprehensive testing against validation suites

5. **User-Facing Update Indicators**:
   - Implement a "knowledge freshness" indicator in the system interface
   - Provide transparency about knowledge component versions when relevant
   - Allow users to request information about when specific data was last updated
   - Create notifications for users when significant updates occur

### Consequences

#### Positive

- System remains accurate and relevant despite game evolution
- Users can trust that advice reflects current cards and rules
- Reduced risk of providing outdated strategic advice
- Transparency about knowledge recency builds user trust
- Incremental updates minimize system downtime

#### Negative

- Additional infrastructure required for automated data collection
- Ongoing maintenance cost for scrapers and data processing
- Potential for temporary inconsistencies during update periods
- Resources required for regular validation and testing
- Risk of data quality issues from automated collection

#### Neutral

- May require API access or partnerships with MTG data providers
- Development team will need to maintain awareness of MTG release schedules
- Could create opportunities for premium features around early access to new set analysis

### Implementation Notes

- Begin developing the data collection infrastructure during Phase 1
- Include update handling in the knowledge retrieval system design
- Create a monitoring dashboard for knowledge component freshness
- Establish clear ownership for knowledge update processes within the team
- Consider caching strategies that account for knowledge updates

### Related Decisions

- Data collection methodology (Phase 1)
- Knowledge graph and RAG system design
- Testing and validation framework
- User interface elements related to knowledge freshness
