# Comprehensive Technical Design Document: MTG AI Reasoning Assistant

_Based on the Mixtral 8x7B Model_  
_Operating on 2×16GB GPUs with Multi-Mode Reasoning (REASON, EXPLAIN, TEACH, PREDICT, RETROSPECT)_

---

## 1. Executive Summary and Technical Vision

**Executive Summary:**  
This document presents an implementation-ready technical design for an MTG (Magic: The Gathering) AI reasoning assistant. The system leverages the Mixtral 8x7B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model augmented via QLoRA fine-tuning and a transaction-based routing architecture. It is designed to run on a dual 16GB GPU system and supports multiple reasoning modes: REASON (analytical chain-of-thought), EXPLAIN (conversational explanation), TEACH (educational tutoring), PREDICT (game outcome forecasting), and RETROSPECT (post-game analysis).

**Technical Vision:**  
Our vision is to build a scalable, modular MTG AI assistant that mimics expert-level reasoning by dynamically routing queries through specialized experts. Each expert not only operates with its own “personality” but also contributes to a transparent reasoning process. This design also incorporates external knowledge integration via a hybrid Knowledge Graph (KG)/Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. In the long run, the architecture is envisioned to support expert knowledge transplantation into larger models, paving the way for recursive, hierarchical expert networks.

## 2. State-of-the-Art Review

### 2.1 Recent Research on MoE Architectures (2023–2025)

- **Switch Transformers (Google, 2021–2023 updates):**  
  Demonstrated that routing tokens to a single expert can scale model capacity with minimal additional compute. Recent work has refined load-balancing and stability.
- **Pathways (Google, 2022–2023):**  
  Introduces a framework for sparse activation that allows billions of parameters to be distributed among many experts, selectively activated per token.
- **GLaM and Megatron-MoE:**  
  These models offer quantitative improvements in both scaling and performance—GLaM achieves near-70B performance with sparse activation, and Megatron-MoE further refines expert routing.

### 2.2 Alternative Architectures Comparison

| Architecture           | Active Params per Token | Total Params | Inference Efficiency | Fine-Tuning Complexity        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Mixtral 8x7B**       | ~13B (2 experts)        | ~40–50B      | High (sparse, fast)  | Moderate (via QLoRA)          |
| **LLaMA-2 70B**        | 70B (dense)             | 70B          | Low (all active)     | High (requires full finetune) |
| **Falcon 40B (dense)** | 40B (dense)             | 40B          | Moderate             | High complexity               |

_Quantitative Analysis:_  
Mixtral 8x7B’s MoE design activates only a fraction of total parameters per token, achieving performance comparable to dense 70B models at a fraction of the compute cost. Empirical benchmarks (e.g., MT-Bench scores from recent studies) show that sparse models can outperform dense counterparts in reasoning tasks when fine-tuned with techniques like QLoRA.

### 2.3 Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for MoE Models

Recent literature emphasizes:

- **QLoRA:** Allows 4-bit quantization with LoRA adapters, dramatically reducing memory footprint during fine-tuning.
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Focuses on adapting only a small subset of parameters, crucial for multi-expert architectures.
- **Curriculum Learning:** Using staged training (from general instruction tuning to domain-specific reasoning) improves stability and performance.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Memory Optimization and Dual-GPU Allocation

- **Byte-Level Allocation Planning:**
  - Use 4-bit quantization for the Mixtral 8x7B model to reduce memory consumption.
  - Partition experts and routing layers across 2×16GB GPUs using tensor parallelism.
  - Reserve ~2GB per GPU for the TinyLLM transaction classifier (which can run on CPU if needed) and caching layers.
  - Detailed GPU memory mapping:
    - GPU 0: Router, experts for REASON and EXPLAIN
    - GPU 1: Experts for TEACH, PREDICT, RETROSPECT, plus shared layers
  - Use libraries such as bitsandbytes and FlashAttention to optimize memory usage.

### 3.2 Transaction-Based MoE Routing with Expert Specialization

- **Core Concept:**  
  Each incoming query is tagged with a transaction type (REASON, EXPLAIN, TEACH, PREDICT, RETROSPECT). A lightweight classifier (TinyLLM) routes the query to the corresponding specialized experts.
- **Novel Routing Algorithm:**  
  A transaction-aware router concatenates a learned transaction embedding with the input representation to compute expert selection weights.

_Example (see Annex below for full code):_

python
class TransactionAwareRouter(nn.Module):
def **init**(self, input_size, num_experts, transaction_embedding_size=128):
super().**init**()
self.transaction_embeddings = nn.Embedding(5, transaction_embedding_size)
self.router = nn.Linear(input_size + transaction_embedding_size, num_experts)

    def forward(self, x, transaction_type: str):
        transaction_id = {"REASON": 0, "EXPLAIN": 1, "TEACH": 2, "PREDICT": 3, "RETROSPECT": 4}[transaction_type]
        transaction_embedding = self.transaction_embeddings(torch.tensor(transaction_id).to(x.device))
        enhanced_input = torch.cat([x, transaction_embedding.expand(x.size(0), -1)], dim=1)
        routing_logits = self.router(enhanced_input)
        routing_weights = F.softmax(routing_logits, dim=-1)
        return routing_weights

### 3.3 Hybrid KG/RAG System with Dynamic Invocation

- **Knowledge Graph (KG):**  
  Structured representation of MTG cards, rules, and relationships. Uses graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) for exact queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  A vector database (e.g., Faiss) indexes unstructured documents (rules, deck guides, card texts) for dynamic context retrieval.
- **Dynamic Invocation:**  
  The system (or model agent) determines whether to call KG or RAG based on query type—using a rule-based classifier or agent prompting.

### 3.4 Custom Attention for Expert Collaboration

- **Proposed Mechanism:**  
  Introduce an “Expert Collaboration Attention” layer that allows experts to cross-attend on shared tokens, thereby resolving disagreements or merging insights. This layer functions after initial expert outputs, weighted by confidence scores from the TinyLLM classifier.

---

## 4. Expert Persona Implementation

### 4.1 Formal Specification for Expert Specialization

- **Definition:**  
  Each expert is an independently fine-tuned sub-module (via LoRA adapters) with a unique identity:
  - _REASON (The Logician)_: Focuses on rigorous analytical chain-of-thought.
  - _EXPLAIN (The Interpreter)_: Converts technical reasoning into accessible language.
  - _TEACH (The Mentor)_: Provides didactic, step-by-step learning.
  - _PREDICT (The Tactician)_: Offers forward-looking scenario predictions.
  - _RETROSPECT (The Historian)_: Analyzes past outcomes to refine strategy.

### 4.2 Novel Training Approach for Developing Distinct Personalities

- **Persona-Infused Data Generation:**  
  Include expert introductions and self-identification in training examples.
- **Dual-Persona Fine-Tuning:**  
  Train each expert’s LoRA adapter on both domain-specific reasoning examples and persona-tagged outputs.

### 4.3 Expert Knowledge Transplantation Framework

- **Process:**  
  When scaling to a larger MoE model, transplant each expert’s adapter weights using guided initialization and architectural mapping.
- **Verification Metrics:**  
  Compare expert outputs on benchmark MTG scenarios (accuracy, reasoning depth, and user satisfaction scores).

### 4.4 Expert Disagreement Resolution Protocol

- **Mechanism:**  
  In multi-expert responses, include an "expert collaboration" phase where experts output a confidence score and their proposed solution. A custom attention layer then aggregates responses weighted by these scores.

---

## 5. Training Methodology

### 5.1 QLoRA Hyperparameter Optimization

- **Recommended Settings (based on recent literature):**
  - Rank (r): 8–16
  - LoRA Alpha: 32
  - Dropout: 0.05
  - Learning Rate: Start at 2e-4 with cosine decay
  - Batch Size: Adjust per device (suggest per-device batch size 1 with gradient accumulation of 8)

### 5.2 Data Generation Pipeline for Synthetic MTG Reasoning

- **Synthetic Data:**  
  Use a high-quality language model (e.g., GPT-4) to generate diverse game state scenarios and chain-of-thought explanations. Validate outputs against expert-reviewed heuristics.

### 5.3 Curriculum Learning Schedule

- **Stage 1:** General instruction tuning (100–150 examples per mode)
- **Stage 2:** Domain-specific fine-tuning with curated MTG examples (200–250 REASON, 150 EXPLAIN, 150 TEACH, 150 PREDICT, 100 RETROSPECT)
- **Stage 3:** Advanced reasoning and adversarial examples (200+ examples; oversample edge cases)

### 5.4 Distributed Training Architecture

- **Setup:**  
  Use PyTorch’s distributed data parallel (DDP) combined with QLoRA; leverage both GPUs with tensor parallelism and gradient checkpointing to fit within 2×16GB.

## 6. Inference Pipeline

### 6.1 Lightweight Transaction Classifier

- **Design:**  
  A TinyLLM (1–2B parameter model) runs on CPU, classifying queries in <10ms.

_Example Code:_

python
class TransactionClassifier:
def **init**(self):
self.model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
"path/to/transaction_classifier", num_labels=5, load_in_8bit=True
).to("cpu")
self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/transaction_classifier")
self.id2label = {0: "REASON", 1: "EXPLAIN", 2: "TEACH", 3: "PREDICT", 4: "RETROSPECT"}

    def classify(self, query: str) -> Tuple[str, float]:
        inputs = self.tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        prediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1).item()
        confidence = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)[0][prediction].item()
        return self.id2label[prediction], confidence

### 6.2 Expert Activation Mechanism

- **Dynamic Adapter Application:**  
  Based on classification, enable only the required expert’s LoRA adapter to minimize GPU memory fragmentation.

### 6.3 Caching System for Expert Outputs

- **Design:**  
  Cache responses keyed by query hash; if a similar query is detected, return the cached output.

### 6.4 Streaming Inference Implementation

- **Progressive Collaboration:**  
  Implement a streaming decoder that progressively aggregates expert responses. Use PyTorch’s streaming generation APIs to gradually reveal the final answer.
