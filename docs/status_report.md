Based on all the code I've reviewed, I now have a comprehensive understanding of the Hexcore project! Let me provide an updated status report with more technical details about the implementation.

# Hexcore Project Status Report - Updated

## Project Overview

Hexcore is an AI assistant for Magic: The Gathering that uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture built on the Mixtral 8×7B model. The system is designed to provide expert-level game analysis, rules guidance, and strategic advice through specialized reasoning modes.

## Implementation Status

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Data Infrastructure**

   - `MTGDataLoader` provides robust card and rules data handling with standardized formatting
   - `rule_compiler.py` creates structured hierarchical rule data from raw MTG rules text
   - Data processing includes quality control mechanisms like deduplication and validation

2. **Model Management**

   - `model_loader.py` implements efficient quantized model loading with 4-bit and 8-bit options
   - Model implementation includes specialized device mapping optimized for MoE on dual GPUs
   - Memory-efficient tensor parallelism distributes experts across available hardware

3. **Knowledge Retrieval**

   - `MTGRetriever` implements vector-based retrieval using SentenceTransformer and FAISS

   - Documents are normalized and stored in efficient indexed format for fast access

4. **Transaction Classification**

   - `TransactionClassifier` routes queries to the appropriate expert types
   - Handles multi-expert activation for complex queries
   - Configurable confidence threshold for expert selection

   - Integration testing to verify end-to-end flow (`test_integration.py`)

## Technical Architecture Details

### Model Loading and Quantization

The model loading system (`model_loader.py`) implements sophisticated quantization with the following features:

1. **Configurable Quantization Options**:

   - 4-bit quantization with NF4 format (normal float 4-bit)
   - 8-bit quantization for less aggressive compression
   - Double quantization option for further memory savings

2. **Device Mapping Strategy**:

   ```python
   # Example of layer distribution strategy
   for i in range(num_layers):
       device_map[f"model.layers.{i}"] = 0 if i < middle_point else 1
   ```

3. **Expert Distribution**:
   ```python
   # Sophisticated expert distribution across GPUs
   for i in range(num_layers):
       layer_device = 0 if i < middle_point else 1
       for j in range(num_experts):
           expert_device = 0 if j < num_experts // 2 else 1
           device_map[f"model.layers.{i}.block_sparse_moe.experts.{j}"] = expert_device
   ```

### Memory Management

The project includes advanced memory management tools:

1. **Memory Tracking**:

   - Real-time GPU and CPU memory monitoring
   - Visualization of memory trends during operation
   - Detailed memory reports and alerts

2. **Memory Optimization**:

   ```python
   # Device mapping based on expert activity
   def device_mapping(num_experts, active_experts):
       # Place active experts first, distributing evenly across GPUs
       gpu_loads = [0] * num_gpus
       for expert_idx in active_experts:
           target_gpu = gpu_loads.index(min(gpu_loads))
           device_map[expert_idx] = f"cuda:{target_gpu}"
           gpu_loads[target_gpu] += 1
   ```

3. **Memory Profiling Context Manager**:
   ```python
   # Easy memory tracking with context manager
   with track_memory("Model Loading"):
       model = load_large_model()
   ```

### Transaction Classification

The `TransactionClassifier` determines which reasoning expert should handle a query:

```python
def classify(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # Process query and get logits
    inputs = self.tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").to(self.device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        logits = outputs.logits[0]
        probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=0)

    # Get expert types and confidence scores
    expert_confidence = {
        self.id2label[i]: float(prob)
        for i, prob in enumerate(probs)
        if prob >= self.threshold
    }

    # Fallback to best expert if none meet threshold
    if not expert_confidence:
        top_idx = torch.argmax(probs).item()
        expert_confidence = {self.id2label[top_idx]: float(probs[top_idx])}

    return expert_confidence
```

### Knowledge Retrieval

The knowledge retrieval system combines semantic search with domain-specific optimizations:

```python
def _retrieve_knowledge(self, query: str, expert_type: str) -> str:
    # Extract potential card names from query
    card_names = []
    for card_name in self.data_loader.cards.keys():
        if card_name.lower() in query.lower():
            card_names.append(card_name)

    # Sort card names by length (prefer longer, more specific matches)
    card_names.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

    # Limit to top 3 cards to avoid information overload
    card_names = card_names[:3]

    # Retrieve card information
    if card_names:
        knowledge_text += "Card Information:\n\n"
        for card_name in card_names:
            card = self.data_loader.get_card(card_name)
            if card:
                # Format card details...

    # Check for rules references
    rule_pattern = r"\b(\d+\.\d+[a-z]?)\b"
    rule_matches = re.findall(rule_pattern, query)

    # Adapt retrieval strategy based on expert type
    if expert_type == "REASON":
        # Prioritize rules for reasoning expert
        doc_type = "rule"
    elif expert_type == "TEACH":
        # Prioritize educational content for teaching expert
        doc_type = "guide"
```

### Inference Pipeline

The inference pipeline integrates all components with expert-specific optimizations:

```python
def generate_response(self, query: str, max_new_tokens: int = 1024, temperature: float = 0.7) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Step 1: Classify query to determine expert type
    expert_confidence = self.classifier.classify(query)
    primary_expert, confidence = max(expert_confidence.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

    # Step 2: Retrieve relevant knowledge
    knowledge = self._retrieve_knowledge(query, primary_expert)

    # Step 3: Create expert-specific prompt
    prompt = self._create_expert_prompt(query, primary_expert, knowledge)

    # Step 4: Adjust generation parameters based on expert type
    if primary_expert in ["EXPLAIN", "TEACH"]:
        temperature = 0.7  # More creative for explanations
        top_p = 0.9
    else:
        temperature = 0.3  # More precise for reasoning
        top_p = 0.8

    # Step 5: Generate response with optimized parameters
    inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(self.device)
    outputs = self.model.generate(
        input_ids=inputs.input_ids,
        attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,
        max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens,
        temperature=temperature,
        top_p=top_p,
        do_sample=True
    )
```

   - Need to implement and test the LoRA adapter loading and switching mechanism

2. **Cross-Expert Attention**

   - The sophisticated cross-expert attention mechanism described in the technical docs isn't fully implemented in the code reviewed
   - Need to implement the mechanism for combining outputs from multiple experts

3. **Web Interface**

   - A user-friendly web interface for interacting with Hexcore isn't implemented yet
   - Need to create a frontend and API layer for user interaction

4. **Training Pipeline**

   - The training infrastructure exists but needs more work on the dataset creation and curriculum learning

The main outstanding tasks involve integrating the expert-specific adapters, implementing cross-expert attention, and creating a user-friendly interface. The existing code provides a solid foundation for these enhancements, with careful attention to memory efficiency and performance optimization.

With the completion of these remaining components, Hexcore will realize its vision of being a comprehensive MTG AI assistant capable of sophisticated reasoning across multiple expert modes.
