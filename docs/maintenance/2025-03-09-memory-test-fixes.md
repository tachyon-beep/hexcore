# Memory Optimization for Integration Tests

**Issue:** OOM errors during integration tests with model loading

## Problem Summary

Integration tests were failing with CUDA out-of-memory (OOM) errors during model loading, specifically when loading embeddings, despite our balanced device mapping:

```text
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 250.00 MiB.
GPU 0 has a total capacity of 15.60 GiB of which 7.06 MiB is free.
```

While our device mapping changes improved the theoretical memory distribution, the actual loading process was still encountering memory barriers, specifically when transferring embeddings to GPU 0.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Fragmented Memory**: The error message mentioned a large reserved but unallocated memory, suggesting memory fragmentation.
2. **Loading Sequence**: The standard Hugging Face loading sequence wasn't considering GPU memory management.
3. **Embedding Loading**: Significant memory spikes occurred when loading the embedding layer.
4. **Missing Memory Cleanup**: Insufficient memory cleanup between loading steps.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Memory Management Utilities

Created a new utility module (`src/utils/memory_management.py`) with specialized functions:

- `clear_gpu_memory()` - Intelligent GPU memory cleanup
- `log_gpu_memory_stats()` - Detailed memory usage monitoring
- `optimize_for_inference()` - Apply inference-specific optimizations
- `load_with_progressive_offloading()` - Progressive model loading with memory management

### 2. Enhanced Model Loading

Modified the `load_quantized_model` function with:

- Progressive loading approach that manages memory during loading
- Multiple fallback strategies if OOM errors occur
- Automatic parameter adjustment for better memory efficiency
- Environment variable configuration for optimal memory usage

### 3. Memory Usage Optimization

Key memory optimizations:

- Setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:64,expandable_segments:True`
- Applying aggressive garbage collection during critical loading phases
- Explicit memory tracking during loading process
- Multi-stage loading with fallback strategies

## Key Code Changes

1. Created memory management utility module
2. Enhanced `load_quantized_model` with memory-optimized loading sequence
3. Added an internal `_load_model_with_memory_optimizations` function for memory-efficient loading
4. Implemented automatic fallback strategies for OOM errors:
   - Trying with different quantization levels (4-bit â†’ 8-bit)
   - Fallback to CPU offloading as a last resort

## Testing and Verification

The memory management improvements should be tested with:

```bash
# Run memory performance tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_memory_performance.py -v

# Run stability tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_stability.py -v

# Run all integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration -v
```

## Optimization Impact

Our optimization approach addresses several key aspects:

1. **Memory Fragmentation**: Through `expandable_segments:True` and memory compaction
2. **Loading Sequence**: Progressive loading to prevent memory spikes
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple recovery paths if initial loading fails

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Consider implementing live memory monitoring during CI tests
2. **Further Device Mapping Research**: Investigate dynamically adjusting device mapping based on real-time memory usage
3. **Memory Profiling**: Regular memory profiling to identify future bottlenecks early

## Conclusion

The implemented memory management enhancements address the OOM errors by improving both the device mapping strategy and the loading process. This comprehensive approach provides both immediate fixes and a foundation for handling future memory challenges as the model grows in complexity.
